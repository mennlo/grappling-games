# Mount Progression and Submissions Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class focuses on developing mount control, position advancement, and submission setups from various positions. Students will learn to progress from standing control through guard passing, ultimately setting up s-mount and arm triangle submissions. The class builds from standing control through progressive position stabilization and control drills to specific submission attacks.

This class consists of several progressive drills that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from various positions covered in class (headquarters, side control, or mount). Focus on applying the position advancement and submission setup techniques learned during class, particularly the progression from guard passing through stabilization to mount control and submissions. Emphasize the importance of stabilizing positions before advancing, recognizing opportunities for s-mount and arm triangle setups, and maintaining control throughout transitions.
