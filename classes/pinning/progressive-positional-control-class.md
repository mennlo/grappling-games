# Progressive Positional Control Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class develops systematic control and escape concepts across standing, guard, and pinning positions. The progression builds through single leg takedown variations, progressive guard passing scenarios, leg drag entries, and mount submission setups. Each game uses progressive difficulty levels where players advance through positions as they achieve success, promoting both attacking control and defensive structure.

This class consists of four progressive drilling games that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from the various positions covered. Focus on applying the progressive control concepts learned during class - advancing through positions systematically as the attacking player, and establishing defensive structure before attempting escapes as the defending player. Emphasize the role-switching element to develop both sides of each position.
