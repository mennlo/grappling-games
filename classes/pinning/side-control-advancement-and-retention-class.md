# Side Control Advancement and Retention Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class develops the pathways into side control from standing, builds retention and frame management, then progresses through underhook control resolution into mount/back stabilization and finally chaining submissions after positional stabilization. 

This class consists of progressive drills (games) that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Standing Drills

### 1.1 - [Underhook Russian Tie Control](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/standing/underhook-russian-tie-control.md)

**Overview:** A standing drill focused on establishing and maintaining an underhook or Russian tie control position while preventing your partner from establishing their own control.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Both Players
**Position:** Standing, facing your partner  
**Objective:** Cover your partner's hands and fight for an underhook or a Russian tie, then maintain this control position  
**Win:** Maintain the control position or successfully pick up a single leg from either control position 


### 1.2 - [T-Position to Bodylock Lift](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/standing/t-position-to-bodylock-lift.md)

**Overview:** A standing drill focusing on transitioning from a T-position underhook to dominant body control. The attacker looks to either connect their hands around the defender's lower body and lift, or achieve tight hip-to-hip connection and lift the defender off the ground. The defender works to deny body connection and choose one of three tactical branches.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacking Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with an underhook on your partner  
**Objective:** Progress from underhook T-position to either (1) connected hand bodylock lift or (2) tight hip-to-hip elevation or (3) pickup a single leg
**Win:** (a) Connect both hands around any part of the defender's lower body (hips/waist/upper thighs) and pick them up so at least one foot leaves the mat, OR (b) achieve hip-to-hip connection and lift opponent so both their feet briefly leave the mat

#### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with overhook and partial torso control defense  
**Objective:** Prevent bodylock or hip-to-hip elevation while pursuing: (1) double inside control, (2) complete separation, or (3) front headlock redirection  
**Win:** (a) Establish double inside control (clear attacker underhook; both arms inside), OR (b) achieve complete separation (no chest/hip contact and attacker loses underhook), OR (c) secure front headlock before attacker lifts

## Pinning Drills

### 2.1 - [Side Framing and Flattening](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-framing-and-flattening.md)

**Overview:** A pinning drill focused on the bottom player preventing being flattened out and maintaining frames, while the top player works to flatten, establish crossface, and secure an underhook.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your side, framing your partner's shoulder line  
**Objective:** Prevent being flattened out and don't allow your partner to establish a crossface and underhook  
**Win:** Get your legs back in between you and your partner or successfully get on top  

#### Top Player
**Position:** On top, in front of your partner's legs, with them on their side  
**Objective:** Stay on top, flatten your partner, and establish a crossface with underhook control  
**Win:** Successfully flatten your partner and establish a crossface with underhook control  

### 2.2 - [Side Control Underhook Battle](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-control-underhook-battle.md)

**Overview:** A pinning game focused on the critical battle when the bottom player has earned an underhook and a hip frame but is still flat. The top player must neutralize the underhook threat before the bottom player can create an escape pathway.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** Flat on back with far-side underhook and near-side frame at top player's hip  
**Objective:** Convert the underhook + frame combination into an escape: reguard, reversal, or build to knees/feet  
**Win:** (a) Get your legs back in between you and the top player (any guard besides quarter guard), OR (b) reverse and come on top, OR (c) successfully get up to your knees or feet  

#### Top Player
**Position:** Chest-to-chest side control, arms any configuration (no initial locked crossface/underhook)  
**Objective:** Shut down the underhook threat, flatten and consolidate dominant control pathways  
**Win:** (a) Establish solid crossface + underhook control, OR (b) transition to chest-to-back with seatbelt grip

### 2.3 - [Side Control to Mount Stabilization](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-control-mount-transition.md)

**Overview:** A positional advancement game focused on the top player flowing from side control to a stabilized mount position, while the bottom player aims to break the advancement early through guard recovery, reversal, or structured turtle.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Top Player
**Position:** Any standard side control variation  
**Objective:** Advance to stabilized mount position  
**Win:** Stabilize mount for a 3-second count  

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** Side control bottom no frames  
**Objective:** Disrupt mount advancement - maintain/rebuild frames, create hip escape angles, recover guard, reverse, or build structured turtle  
**Win:** (a) Reguard with at least control above the knee (no quarter guard), OR (b) reverse and come on top, OR (c) build to turtle with back uncovered

### 2.4 - [Side Control to Mount/Back to Submission Chain](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-control-mount-or-back-to-submission-chain.md)

**Overview:** A chained advancement game: the top player must flow from side control to either mount or chest-to-back and then secure a controlled submission catch-and-release. The bottom player works to interrupt links in the chainâ€”preventing positional advancement or breaking submission attempts.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Top Player
**Position:** Any side control variation  
**Objective:** Advance to mount or chest-to-back and then obtain a clean submission catch (controlled, no crank)  
**Win:** Stabilize mount or chest-to-back (seatbelt) AND obtain a clean controlled submission catch/finish (arm triangle, collar choke, armbar, back choke, etc.) before bottom player escapes

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** Side control bottom with at least one frame  
**Objective:** Disrupt chain at any link: deny positional advancement or defeat submission attempt via escape/recovery  
**Win:** (a) Reguard with at least control above the knee (no quarter guard), OR (b) reverse and come on top, OR (c) build to turtle with back uncovered  

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from side control position. Focus on applying the frame management and underhook neutralization techniques learned during class, as well as practicing the mount vs. back decision branching when opportunities arise. Bottom players should practice the early chain disruption and guard recovery methods learned in the drills.
