# Turtle Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class develops fundamental turtle attack concepts, starting with standing back control transitions to front headlock, progressing through grounded front headlock control and transitions, and culminating with turtle position attacks focusing on hip control, crucifix entry, clock choke setup, and back control transitions. The progression builds from standing control to grounded control, then specifically to turtle position dominance and back control development.

This class consists of progressive drills (games) that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from turtle position. Focus on applying the turtle attack mechanics learned during class, emphasizing the importance of hip control, maintaining front headlock pressure, and recognizing opportunities to transition from front headlock to turtle dominance. Defenders should practice the defensive posture and escape timing learned in the drills.
