# Side Control Submissions Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class develops pathways from standing control into side control, builds fundamental frame management and flattening mechanics, then progresses through specific submission setups from side control to mount control with finishing mechanics. The progression emphasizes maintaining control while hunting for submissions.

This class consists of progressive drills (games) that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Standing Drills

### 1.1 - [Underhook Russian Tie Control](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/standing/underhook-russian-tie-control.md)

**Overview:** A standing drill focused on establishing and maintaining an underhook or Russian tie control position while preventing your partner from establishing their own control.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Both Players
**Position:** Standing, facing your partner  
**Objective:** Cover your partner's hands and fight for an underhook or a Russian tie, then maintain this control position  
**Win:** Maintain the control position or successfully pick up a single leg from either control position 

### 1.2 - [T-Position Takedown Pathways](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/standing/t-position-takedown-pathways.md)

**Overview:** A standing drill focusing on transitioning from a T-position underhook to dominant body control. The attacker looks to secure a bodylock (front or back), pick up a single leg, pick up a double leg, or achieve tight hip-to-hip connection and lift the defender off the ground. The defender works to deny body connection and choose one of three tactical branches.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacking Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with an underhook on your partner  
**Objective:** Progress from underhook T-position to either (1) bodylock (front or back), (2) double leg pickup, (3) single leg pickup, or (4) tight hip-to-hip elevation  
**Win:** (a) Secure a bodylock (front or back), OR (b) successfully pick up a double leg, OR (c) successfully pick up a single leg, OR (d) drive the back of your hips into the front of defender's hips and lift opponent so both their feet briefly leave the mat

#### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with overhook and partial torso control defense  
**Objective:** Prevent bodylock, single leg, double leg, or hip-to-hip elevation while pursuing: (1) double inside control, (2) complete separation, or (3) front headlock redirection  
**Win:** (a) Establish double inside control (clear attacker underhook; both arms inside), OR (b) achieve complete separation (no chest/hip contact and attacker loses underhook), OR (c) secure front headlock before attacker lifts

## Pinning & Submission Drills

### 2.1 - [Side Framing and Flattening](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-framing-and-flattening.md)

**Overview:** A pinning drill focused on the bottom player preventing being flattened out and maintaining frames, while the top player works to flatten, establish crossface, and secure an underhook.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your side, framing your partner's shoulder line  
**Objective:** Prevent being flattened out and don't allow your partner to establish a crossface and underhook  
**Win:** Get your legs back in between you and your partner or successfully get on top  

#### Top Player
**Position:** On top, in front of your partner's legs, with them on their side  
**Objective:** Stay on top, flatten your partner, and establish a crossface with underhook control  
**Win:** Successfully flatten your partner and establish a crossface with underhook control  

### 2.2 - [Side Control Head and Arm Attacks](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-control-arm-triangle-setup.md)

**Overview:** A transitional drill focusing on advancing from side control to various head and arm attacks (arm triangle, darce, anaconda, or guillotine), with the bottom player having only limited frames to defend.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Top Player
**Position:** On top in side control with an underhook on the far arm and crossface control  
**Objective:** Work the underhook up toward the shoulder line and set up any head and arm attack (arm triangle, darce, anaconda, or guillotine)  
**Win:** Successfully establish head and arm connection or finish any head and arm submission  

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back in bottom side control with only a frame at the hip  
**Objective:** Use limited defensive resources to recover guard or reverse the position  
**Win:** Successfully recover any form of guard or reverse the position  

### 2.3 - [Side Control Figure Four Attack](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/side-control-figure-four-attack.md)

**Overview:** A ground-based drill focusing on attacking with the figure four arm control from side control and defending against it to recover guard.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Top Player
**Position:** In side control position over your partner  
**Objective:** Establish a figure four control on your partner's arm and work toward submission (figure four shoulder lock, armbar, or other arm attacks)  
**Win:** Successfully establish figure four control or complete a submission

#### Bottom Player
**Position:** Pinned in bottom side control  
**Objective:** Defend against the figure four control and work to recover any form of guard  
**Win:** Successfully escape the position and recover guard  

### 2.4 - [Mount Wrist Control to Submission](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/pinning/mount/mount-wrist-control-to-submission.md)

**Overview:** A drill starting from mount with wrist control where the top player works to maintain control and secure submissions from any top position (mount, side control, knee on belly, etc.) while staying out of guard. The bottom player works to free their wrists, establish defensive frames, and escape to guard or reverse position.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Top Player
**Position:** Mounted on top with wrist control on one of the bottom player's arms  
**Objective:** Maintain wrist control and work to submit the bottom player from any dominant position while staying out of their guard  
**Win:** Successfully submit the bottom player with any submission while maintaining a dominant position (mount, side control, knee on belly, back control, etc.)

**Position:** On back with partner mounted on top, one wrist controlled  
**Objective:** Free your wrists, establish defensive frames, and escape to guard or reverse position  
**Win:** Get back to guard with at least one of the top player's legs controlled above the knee, or roll them over and become the top player

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from side control position. Focus on applying the frame management and submission setup techniques learned during class, as well as practicing the transitions from side control to mount when hunting for submissions. Bottom players should practice early defensive frame maintenance and guard recovery methods learned in the drills.
