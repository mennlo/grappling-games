# Back Defense and Prevention Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class focuses on developing defensive skills and prevention techniques against back control progression. Students will learn to defend at each stage of back control development, from initial standing contact through various levels of control. The class follows a progressive flow: standing separation to bodylock, bodylock to turtle breakdown, turtle to hip control, and then defending against increasingly dominant back control positions.

This class consists of several progressive drills that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from various back control positions. Focus on applying the defensive techniques learned during class, particularly the progression from early prevention to late-stage escapes. 

**Key Defensive Concepts:**
- Defenders should consistently fight to separate the attacking player's hands to break seatbelt grips
- Focus on hand fighting as the primary defensive strategy before attempting position changes
- Use systematic approach to escape: separate hands, address hooks, then improve position

Attacking players should practice applying controlled pressure while defending players focus on the escape techniques and defensive positioning learned in the drills.
