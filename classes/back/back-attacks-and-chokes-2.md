# Back Attacks and Chokes Class 2
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class focuses on developing effective attacks and chokes from back control positions. Students will learn to establish and maintain back control while working through various submission options including arm pins, rear naked chokes, gi chokes, and advanced back attacks. The class begins with standing single leg control and counters to develop entry skills before progressing to back control submissions.

This class consists of several progressive drills that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from back control positions. Focus on applying the back attack techniques learned during class, particularly the progression from positional control to submission setups. Defending players should practice the escape techniques and defensive positioning learned in the drills. The standing drills at the beginning help develop the takedown entries that can lead to back control opportunities in live rolling.
