# Knee Cut Class 3
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class advances knee cut passing concepts through single leg defense and quarter guard control, progressing through Head Quarters position establishment, knee slice and leg weave passing mechanics, and culminating with side control transition work. The progression builds from standing single leg defense through multiple passing positions and finishes with positional control and transition drilling from side control.

This class consists of progressive drills (games) that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.
