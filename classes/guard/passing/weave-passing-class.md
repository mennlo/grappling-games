## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from various guard positions. Focus on applying the weave passing mechanics learned during class, as well as practicing the HQ to leg weave transitions when opportunities arise. Bottom players should practice the knee shield defense and guard retention methods learned in the drills, with special attention to maintaining proper hip positioning and creating sweep opportunities when the passer commits to weave positions.
