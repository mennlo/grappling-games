# Leg Drag to Back Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class focuses on guard passing techniques using the leg drag to transition directly to back control. Students will learn to establish the leg drag position, navigate through different guard types, and secure back control with proper seatbelt positioning. The class emphasizes control and positioning rather than speed.

This class consists of several progressive drills that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.
