# Kimura Control and Attacks Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class develops kimura-based control concepts across standing, guard, and pinning positions. The progression builds from grounded front headlock transitions to standing T-position attacks, then advances through closed guard attack setups, half guard kimura control, and side control transitional work. The class culminates with submission-focused passing from knee shield half guard. Each game emphasizes using the kimura grip as both a finishing position and a control tool for advancing position.

This class consists of six progressive drilling games that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

### 1.2 - [T-Position to Takedown Entries](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/standing/t-position-takedown-pathways.md)

**Overview:** A standing drill focusing on transitioning from a T-position underhook to dominant body control. The attacker looks to secure a bodylock (front or back), pick up a single leg, pick up a double leg, or achieve tight hip-to-hip connection and lift the defender off the ground.

**Objective:** Prevent bodylock, single leg, double leg, or hip-to-hip elevation while pursuing: (1) double inside control, (2) complete separation, or (3) front headlock redirection  
**Constraints:** Stay upright (no intentional dropping to knees)  
**Win:** (a) Establish double inside control (clear attacker underhook; both arms inside), OR (b) achieve complete separation (no chest/hip contact and attacker loses underhook), OR (c) secure front headlock before attacker lifts
