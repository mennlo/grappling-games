**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Controlling Player
**Position:** Kneeling or standing over your partner who is on hands/elbows and knees, with a chin strap and tricep grip in the front headlock position  
**Objective:** Maintain head control while transitioning from head and arm control on one side to head and arm on the other side  
**Win:** Successfully transition from side to side while keeping your partner's head covered  

#### Defending Player
**Position:** On hands/elbows and knees with your head trapped in your partner's front headlock control  
**Objective:** Work to uncover your head and establish guard by getting your legs between you and your partner  
**Win:** Uncover your head and successfully establish guard by getting your legs between you and your partner, OR connect to a leg and tip them down to their butt to come on top and free your head

### 1.2 - [Guillotine Defense vs Single Leg](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/standing/guillotine-defense-single-leg.md)

**Overview:** A drilling exercise where partners alternate between defending a single leg takedown using a guillotine choke grip and sacrifice throw, and attacking with a single leg while defending against the guillotine counter.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacking Player
**Position:** Controlling your partner's leg in a head-inside single leg configuration, with your head on their chest and arms controlling the captured leg

#### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing on one leg with your partner controlling your other leg in a head-inside single leg  
**Objective:** Wrap your arm around your partner's neck, secure the guillotine grip with your other hand, and pull their head tight to your chest. Either finish the guillotine submission from standing, or execute a sacrifice throw by squatting down and falling to the side while maintaining the choke. Alternatively, disconnect and escape the single leg  
**Win:** Submit your partner with the guillotine choke, or escape the single leg (either by disconnecting fully or via sacrifice throw)
