# Butterfly Guard Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class develops butterfly guard fundamentals and related concepts, starting with standing control and inside position establishment, progressing through T-position control and takedown pathways, and culminating with butterfly guard control, sweeps, and pass defense. The progression builds from standing wrestling control to specific butterfly guard mechanics and applications.

This class consists of progressive drills (games) that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from butterfly guard position. Focus on applying the butterfly guard control and sweep mechanics learned during class, emphasizing the importance of maintaining inside position with hooks, controlling posture with upper body grips, and timing sweeps with opponent's movements. Top players should practice the grip stripping and leg splitting methods learned in the drills, with special attention to maintaining base and posture while working to pass the guard.
