# Closed Guard Transitions and Attacks Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class focuses on developing closed guard transitions and submission setups from various guard positions. Students will learn to progress from standing control through guard transitions, ultimately setting up triangle and omoplata submissions. The class builds from T-position control through progressive guard passing and guard transition drills to specific submission attacks.

This class consists of several progressive drills that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

**Overview:** A standing drill focusing on transitioning from a T-position underhook to dominant body control. The attacker looks to secure a bodylock, pick up a single leg, or achieve tight hip-to-hip connection and lift.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacking Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with an underhook on your partner  
**Objective:** Progress from underhook T-position to either (1) bodylock (front or back), (2) single leg pickup, or (3) tight hip-to-hip elevation  
**Constraints:** No throws beyond controlled elevation; partner must land safely with feet under them  
**Win:** (a) Secure a bodylock (front or back), OR (b) successfully pick up a single leg, OR (c) drive the back of your hips into the front of defender's hips and lift opponent so both their feet briefly leave the mat

#### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with overhook and partial torso control defense  
**Objective:** Prevent bodylock, single leg, double leg, or hip-to-hip elevation while pursuing: (1) double inside control, (2) complete separation, or (3) front headlock redirection  
**Constraints:** Stay upright (no intentional dropping to knees)  
**Win:** (a) Establish double inside control (clear attacker underhook; both arms inside), OR (b) achieve complete separation (no chest/hip contact and attacker loses underhook), OR (c) secure front headlock before attacker lifts

## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from closed guard position. Focus on applying the closed guard transitions and submission techniques learned during class, particularly the guard transition mechanics and submission setup details practiced in the specific drills. Emphasize the importance of maintaining control during transitions, recognizing opportunities for submissions from various guard positions, and chaining attacks together when initial attempts are defended.
