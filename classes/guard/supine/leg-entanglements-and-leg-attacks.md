# Leg Entanglements and Leg Attacks Class
**Class Length:** 1 hour

This class focuses on developing leg entanglement skills and leg attack techniques, specifically targeting kneebars and toeholds. Students will learn to establish leg entanglements, maintain control, and transition to leg attacks while understanding proper defensive principles. The class emphasizes safety and proper positioning for leg attacks without applying finishing pressure.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE:** All leg attack drills in this class focus on achieving proper catch positions without applying finishing pressure. Students must demonstrate control and immediately release. This is a catch-and-release format for safety.

This class consists of several progressive drills that build upon each other. Each drill is available as an individual game file for reference.

## Leg Connection and Control Drills

### 1.1 - [Seated Guard Leg Connection Control](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/guard/supine/seated-guard-leg-connection-control.md)

**Overview:** A dynamic drill where an attacker in seated guard maintains connection to a standing defender's leg, working to off-balance and entangle for takedowns or sweeps, while the defender tries to flatten the attacker and maintain control.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacker
**Position:** Seated in guard position (sit-up or shin-on-shin) with connection to one of the defender's legs  
**Objective:** Off-balance the defender, elevate or entangle the leg, and transition to a takedown or sweep to become the top player  
**Win:** Successfully complete a takedown or sweep to become the top player

#### Defender
**Position:** Standing with one leg connected/controlled by the seated attacker  
**Objective:** Flatten the attacker onto their back and keep them flat for 3 seconds  
**Win:** Successfully flatten the attacker and maintain them on their back for 3+ seconds

## Leg Entanglement Development

### 2.1 - [Inside Position Shootout](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/guard/supine/inside-position-shootout.md)

**Overview:** A competitive leg entanglement drill where both players start seated with mixed leg positions, each holding their opponent's ankles. Both players race to establish inside position with their feet and entangle their opponent's leg with a hip connection.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Both Players
**Position:** Both seated with one leg inside and one leg outside their partner's legs, both holding each other's ankles  
**Objective:** Get both feet to inside position and entangle opponent's leg with a connection to the hip  
**Win:** Successfully achieve inside position with both feet and establish hip connection on opponent's leg

### 2.2 - [Imbalanced Inside Position Shootout with Standing](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/guard/supine/imbalanced-inside-position-shootout-with-standing.md)

**Overview:** An advanced leg entanglement drill where one player starts with inside position advantage while both players work to either stand up clean or establish dominant grounded control with hip attachment and ankle wrap.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Both Players
**Position:** Both seated, with the attacker having inside position with their legs and both players holding their partner's ankles  
**Objective:** Get up to standing position without legs entangled, OR get attached to opponent's hip and wrap their ankle with your arm while both players remain grounded  
**Win:** Successfully stand up with legs completely free of entanglement, OR achieve hip attachment with the ankle wrapped while the defender is grounded

## Leg Attack Specific Drills

### Kneebar and Toehold Rules ( only allowed during drilling, not live rolling for white belts )

**Kneebar:** Connect both hands around the heel with the leg straight. Focus on achieving this grip position without applying hyperextension pressure to the knee joint.

**Toehold:** Connect one hand around the toes and the other hand wrapped behind the ankle and connecting to the other wrist. Focus on achieving this grip position without applying finishing pressure or cranking the ankle.

**Important:** These drills are about achieving proper catch positions - NOT finishing submissions. Demonstrate control, then reset. Attackers focus on maintaining a tight connection above the knee line close to the hip. Defenders focus on separating the knees, and pushing on the attacker to escape the entanglement and free their knee line. **During any time drilling, if the defender is feeling unsafe or is unsure about the safety of the position, they should tap out and both players reset.**

### 3.1 - [Kneebar and Toehold Catch](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/guard/supine/kneebar-and-toehold-catch.md)

**Overview:** A leg attack drill where the attacking player starts with leg entanglement from a mounted position, then falls to the side to set up kneebar and toehold attacks, while the defender works to escape the leg entanglement and free their knee line.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacking Player
**Position:** Starting sitting on defender's stomach with one of the defender's legs entangled, holding around both of the defender's knees  
**Objective:** Fall off to one side and maintain control of the leg(s) to transition to a kneebar or toehold catch position  
**Win:** Successfully achieve proper grip position for kneebar (both hands around heel with leg straight) or toehold control - do NOT apply finishing pressure

#### Defending Player
**Position:** On your back with one leg entangled and controlled by the attacking player who is sitting on your stomach  
**Objective:** Escape the leg entanglement and free your knee line when the attacker falls to the side  
**Win:** Successfully escape the leg entanglement and free your knee line completely

### 3.2 - [Ashi Garami Leg Attack](https://mennlo.github.io/grappling-games/md-viewer.html?file=games/guard/supine/ashi-garami-leg-attack.md)

**Example:** Show how to switch between ashi garami to outside ashi garami to sit up into different leg entanglements, with potential for knee bars / toe holds. 

**Overview:** A leg attack drill where the attacking player starts on their back in ashi garami position with one leg entangled, working to maintain control and transition to leg attacks, while the defending player works to escape the leg entanglement and free their knee line.

**Time:** 3 minutes, 3 partners or 9 minutes total - switching back and forth

#### Attacking Player
**Position:** On your back with one leg entangled in ashi garami position, arm over their leg, but not wrapping the ankle yet  
**Objective:** Maintain control of the entangled leg and transition to ankle lock, kneebar, or toehold catch position  
**Win:** Successfully achieve proper catch position for ankle lock, kneebar, or toehold - do NOT apply finishing pressure outside of ankle lock

#### Defending Player
**Position:** Sitting in front of your partner with one leg entangled in their ashi garami.  
**Objective:** Escape the leg entanglement and free your knee line  
**Win:** Successfully escape the ashi garami position and completely disconnect/free your leg  


## Conclusion

Finish class with Q&A and some live rolling starting from seated guard or leg entanglement positions. Focus on applying the leg entanglement and control techniques learned during class. 

**SAFETY EMPHASIS for Live Rolling:** All leg attacks for white belts in live rolling are ankle lock only. All leg attacks for blue belts and above can include kneebar and toehold, but must be done with control and finished slowly.
