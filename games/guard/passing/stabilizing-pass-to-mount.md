## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player hugging the bottom player's legs with both legs on one side
2. Top player works to stabilize the position and advance to s-mount or arm triangle
3. Bottom player works to recover guard by getting feet back on hips/biceps, closing guard, or standing up
4. If the bottom player gets feet back on hips/biceps, establishes closed guard, or stands up, reset to starting position
5. If the top player achieves s-mount or arm triangle position and holds for 3 seconds (or finishes submission if agreed), reset to starting position
6. After time expires, switch roles

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- First priority is to stabilize by getting chest to chest or transitioning to side control
- Keep your head on the opposite side of their legs to prevent them from turning into you
- Use your weight to pin their hips while transitioning
- Don't rush to mount - stabilize in side control first if needed
- Control their near arm as you transition to prevent frames
- Be patient and methodical with position advancement

For the bottom player:
- Create space immediately by framing against their hips or shoulders
- Turn your hips toward your partner to help recover guard
- Get your bottom leg free first, then work on the top leg
- Use your hands on their hips to create distance
- Look for opportunities to insert your knee back into guard
- If they give space, explode up to stand
- Don't allow them to settle their weight - stay active
