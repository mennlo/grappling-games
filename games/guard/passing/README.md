## Teaching Notes

When teaching these drills, consider the following:

1. Start with the standing drills to develop grip fighting awareness
2. Progress to the HQ position to establish initial control
3. Move through the quarter guard variations (double underhooks, overhook/underhook, upright)
4. Practice the half guard flattening drill as a related position
5. Finish with live training to apply all techniques

Each drill builds upon skills developed in the previous exercises, creating a comprehensive approach to quarter guard passing.
