## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Use your grips to control distance and prevent sweeps
- Keep good posture and base to defend against sweeps
- Look for opportunities to stuff the inside leg and advance
- Control the near arm as you pass to set up submissions
- Be aware of submission attempts as you pass
- Progress methodically from pass to side control to mount positions
- Don't rush - stabilize each position before advancing

For the bottom player:
- Use your grip to off-balance your partner and create sweep opportunities
- Look for opportunities to elevate with your feet
- Use your inside leg to create frames and prevent the pass
- Be ready to transition to submissions if they commit to passing
- If they give you space, look to stand up
- Chain attacks together - sweeps to submissions, or vice versa
- Control their posture with your grips to limit their passing options
