## Coaching Points
For the guard puller:
- Use your grips to off-balance your partner as you pull guard
- Keep your legs active to prevent easy foot removal
- Focus on pulling your partner forward to their hands or forcing them to sit
- Maintain grip control throughout the transition
- Use your legs to hook and control your partner's legs
- If they get past your feet, immediately work to recover guard or create scrambles

For the top player:
- Stay light on your feet and maintain good posture
- Work to break grips or control the guard puller's hands
- Focus on removing feet quickly but safely
- Keep your base wide and stay standing throughout the initial phase
- Once feet are removed, work efficiently to complete the pass
- Don't rush - maintain good posture to avoid being off-balanced
- Focus on achieving dominant chest contact once the legs are cleared
