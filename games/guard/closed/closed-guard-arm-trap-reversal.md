## Instructions

3. Top player focuses on freeing their arms and creating space to escape the trap
4. Top player must first address the arm trap before attempting to open the guard
5. Bottom player can transition to back control or various sweeps depending on top player's reactions
6. Reset when either player achieves their win condition

## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Keep your chest tight to their shoulder to maintain the trap
- Use your legs to off-balance your partner and create sweep opportunities
- Look for back exposure when your partner tries to escape
- Don't release pressure - maintain constant control throughout
- Be ready to adjust your grips as your partner attempts to escape

For top player:
- Stay calm and methodically work to free your arms
- Create frames to separate from their chest pressure
- Once arms are free, immediately work to establish posture
- Don't panic and try to explode out - this often leads to being swept
- Once guard opens, quickly control the legs to prevent re-guard
