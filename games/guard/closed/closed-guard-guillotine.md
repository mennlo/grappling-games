# Closed Guard Guillotine

## Overview
A closed guard drill where the attacker starts with a chin strap grip and works to connect their hands to establish either an arm-in or arm-out guillotine, while the defender focuses on preventing the hand connection and escaping the head control.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacker
**Position:** Sitting with closed guard, one arm over your partner's neck with a chin strap grip, and the other arm on your partner's back  
**Objective:** Connect your hands while wrapping your partner's neck to establish either an arm-in or arm-out guillotine  
**Win:** Successfully connect your hands and establish guillotine control (either variation)  

### Defender
**Position:** Kneeling inside your partner's closed guard with your head caught in a single-arm chin strap grip  
**Objective:** Fight to prevent your partner from connecting their hands and establishing either guillotine variation  
**Win:** Successfully prevent the hand connection and escape the chin strap control  

## Instructions
1. Attacker sits with closed guard and establishes a chin strap grip with one arm
2. Attacker attempts to wrap their other arm around and connect their hands
3. Attacker can choose to wrap around the defender's arm (arm-in guillotine) or only around the neck (arm-out guillotine)
4. Defender works to block the connecting arm and escape the chin strap grip
5. Reset after the attacker successfully connects their hands or the defender escapes
6. Switch roles after the time period

## Coaching Points
For Attackers:
- Use your legs to control your partner's posture and limit their mobility
- Apply pressure with the chin strap grip to distract from your second hand connecting
- Look for angles to sneak your second arm through for the connection
- For arm-in guillotine: trap your partner's arm as you connect your hands for added control
- For arm-out guillotine: focus on keeping your partner's arm out as you connect your hands
- Once hands are connected, focus on proper guillotine mechanics (wrist positioning, elbow alignment)

For Defenders:
- Maintain good posture to reduce pressure from the chin strap
- Fight the connecting hand by blocking and controlling your partner's free wrist
- Create frames to prevent the second arm from wrapping around
- Be aware of whether your arm is inside or outside the guillotine attempt and adjust defense accordingly
- Look for opportunities to posture up and create space
