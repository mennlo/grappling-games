## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Focus on side crunching to create pressure on both sides of the neck
- Think about touching the top of your partner's head to the mat to increase pressure
- Keep your legs active in the closed guard to prevent your partner from posturing up
- Squeeze with your arms while crunching with your abs for maximum pressure
- Use your legs to pull your partner down if they start to posture up
- Maintain a tight grip with your hands to prevent them from being peeled off

For top player:
- Use your free arm to fight their gripping hands
- Create pressure with your shoulder into their chest/diaphragm
- Keep your posture tall when possible to reduce their ability to crunch
- Maintain base with your knees to prevent being rolled
- Once you start escaping, commit fully to posturing up or side escaping
