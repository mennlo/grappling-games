## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Use your legs to keep your partner's posture broken while working for chokes
- Look for cross collar chokes, loop chokes, and other gi choke variations
- When your partner defends the choke, transition to sweeps
- Common sweeps include scissor sweep, hip bump sweep, and flower sweep
- Chain your attacks together - if the choke fails, use their defensive reaction for a sweep
- Keep your grip on the collar throughout to maintain offensive control

For top player:
- Focus on regaining your posture first before attempting to pass
- Keep your elbows tight to your body to defend against additional collar grips
- Use frames against your partner's hips to create space
- Be aware of sweep attempts when defending chokes
- When standing, focus on breaking the closed guard by pushing your knee into your partner's tailbone
- Protect your collar by keeping your chin down and controlling your partner's wrists
- If you can't regain posture, work to split the legs for half guard
