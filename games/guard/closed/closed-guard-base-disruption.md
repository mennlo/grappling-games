## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Use hip movement and leverage rather than just strength
- Look for opportunities to break your partner's posture by pulling them forward
- Combine techniques like arm drags, collar pulls, and hip bumps
- Control your partner's arms to limit their ability to base
- Work for overhook positions when your partner leans forward
- Use your legs to off-balance your partner and create openings

For top player:
- Maintain good posture with your head up and chest forward
- Keep your base wide for stability while working to open the guard
- Frame against your partner's hips to create space and prevent being pulled down
- Use hand positioning on the hips or thighs to begin opening the guard
- Stay active - don't just defend, work toward your guard passing goals
- Counter your partner's base disruption attempts by immediately reestablishing posture
