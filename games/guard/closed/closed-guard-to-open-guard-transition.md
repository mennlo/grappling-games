- Be ready to quickly establish foot placement if your partner stands
- Use your hips and frames to prevent your partner from passing to half guard

For top player:
- Maintain pressure when the bottom player opens their guard
- Look for opportunities to split the legs and establish half guard
- When standing, control your partner's legs to prevent them from establishing foot positions
- Keep your posture strong to make it difficult for your partner to control your arms
