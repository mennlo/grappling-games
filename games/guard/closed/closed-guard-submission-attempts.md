# Closed Guard Submission Attempts

## Overview
A closed guard drill where the bottom player works to finish submissions (kimura, guillotine, or sweep) while the top player defends and works to escape to safe positions.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your back with closed guard around your partner's waist  
**Objective:** Work to finish a submission - kimura, guillotine (arm-in or arm-out)
**Win:** Successfully submit your partner with any of these techniques, sweep, or take the back

### Top Player
**Position:** Kneeling inside your partner's closed guard  
**Objective:** Defend against submission attempts and work to escape to a safe position (standing with guard open, half guard, or side control)  
**Win:** Successfully open the guard and transition to half guard (if on knees) or split the legs (if standing) with no submission threat

## Instructions
1. Bottom player starts with closed guard around top player's waist
2. Bottom player works to finish any of the two submissions:
   - Kimura from closed guard
   - Guillotine (arm-in or arm-out)
3. Top player defends and works to reach a safe position without submission threat
4. Reset when bottom player gets a tap or when top player successfully escapes to a safe position
5. Switch roles after the predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Use your legs to break your partner's posture before attempting submissions
- Chain your attacks together - when one submission is defended, flow to another
- For kimura: isolate the arm, secure the figure-four grip, and break down posture
- For guillotine: establish chin strap, connect hands with proper grip, and squeeze with proper mechanics
- Don't rush - control the position first, then work for the finish

For top player:
- Keep your elbows tight to your body to prevent easy grips
- Maintain strong posture with head up and back straight
- For kimura defense: keep your hand connected to your belt or their gi, don't let arm get isolated
- For guillotine defense: create space at the neck, posture up, and look to pass to the side
- When escaping, ensure all submission threats are cleared before stopping
- Standing up can be effective but must lead to opening the guard completely
