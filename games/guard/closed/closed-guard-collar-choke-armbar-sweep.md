## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Break your partner's posture first before attempting attacks
- Look for collar chokes when you can establish grips
- Watch for armbar opportunities when your partner defends collar grips or posts
- When attacks are defended, transition to sweeps
- Common sweeps include scissor sweep, hip bump sweep, and flower sweep
- Chain your attacks together - if the choke fails, use their defensive reaction for an armbar or sweep
- For armbars, focus on hip movement and controlling your partner's posture
- Keep your hips high when attacking with armbars

For top player:
- Keep your elbows tight to your body to prevent kimura grips and armbar setups
- Maintain strong posture with head up and back straight
- Protect your collar by keeping your chin down and controlling your partner's wrists
- Be aware of armbar attacks when your partner breaks your posture
- Use frames against your partner's hips to create space before standing
- When standing, focus on breaking the closed guard by pushing your knee into your partner's tailbone
- If you can't maintain posture, work to split the legs for half guard
- Keep your hands in safe positions to avoid submission attempts
