## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Use hip movement and off-balancing to force your partner to post their hands
- When your partner posts, quickly establish collar grips before they can recover
- Keep your closed guard tight throughout to maintain control
- Break your partner's posture down as you establish grips
- Work to connect your head to your partner's head for maximum control
- If your partner defends one collar, immediately work for the other
- Chain your grip attempts together - don't give up if the first attempt fails
- Use your legs to prevent your partner from creating distance

For top player:
- Keep your elbows tight to your body to protect against grips
- Cover your partner's hands with your own to prevent collar grips
- When your partner gets a grip, work immediately to strip it before they can establish the second
- Maintain strong posture to make it harder for your partner to control your head
- Use frames against your partner's hips to create space before attempting to open the guard
- When standing, keep your chin down and hands protecting your collar
- Apply consistent pressure to one side to split the legs
- If you can't open the guard, work to transition to standing to change angles
