# Closed Guard Attack Options

## Overview
A closed guard drill where the bottom player works to establish multiple offensive control positions while the top player defends and maintains posture or starts passing.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your back with closed guard around your partner's waist  
**Objective:** Work to establish a kimura grip, wrap your arm and connect hands around their neck, or make them post to the side  
**Win:** Successfully lock up a kimura grip, wrap your arm and connect your hands around their partner's neck (with or without the arm), or make them post to the side 3 times/sweep

#### Top Player
**Position:** Kneeling inside your partner's closed guard  
**Objective:** Stand up with proper posture and open the closed guard or split your partner's legs to establish half guard  
**Win:** Successfully stand up while maintaining good posture and open the closed guard or transition to half guard position  

## Instructions
1. Bottom player starts with closed guard around top player's waist
2. Bottom player works to achieve any of the three win conditions:
   - Lock up a kimura grip on either arm
   - Wrap your arm around their neck (arm in or not) and connect your hands (guillotine-style control)
   - Force partner to post their hand to the side 3 separate times
3. Top player works to maintain posture and defend against attacks
4. The round ends when bottom player achieves any win condition or time expires
5. Reset and repeat, switching roles after the predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Use your legs to break your partner's posture before attempting attacks
- Chain your attacks together to create reactions
- For the kimura grip, focus on isolating the arm first before securing the grip
- When working for the guillotine-style control, keep your elbows tight and chest connected
- To force posts, use hip movement and arm drags to disrupt your partner's base
- Count the posts out loud to keep track

For top player:
- Keep your elbows tight to your body to prevent kimura grips
- Maintain strong posture with head up and back straight
- Use frames against your partner's hips before attempting to stand up
- Create pressure on one side to help split the legs for half guard
- When standing, focus on breaking the closed guard by pushing your knee into your partner's tailbone
- Keep your hands in safe positions to avoid submission attempts
- Be aware of your weight distribution to avoid being easily tipped to either side
