# Ashi Garami Leg Attack

## Overview
A leg attack drill where the attacking player starts on their back in ashi garami position with one leg entangled, working to maintain control and transition to leg attacks, while the defending player works to escape the leg entanglement and free their knee line.

**Important Safety Note:** This drill focuses on achieving the proper grip positions for submissions without applying finishing pressure. For kneebar: connect both hands around the heel with the leg straight. For toehold: connect one hand around the toes and the other hand around the heel with the foot flexed. For ankle lock: control the ankle and heel. Do NOT finish these submissions - focus on achieving the catch position only.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacking Player
**Position:** On your back with one leg entangled in ashi garami position (opponent's leg between your legs with your top leg controlling their thigh)  
**Objective:** Maintain control of the entangled leg and transition to ankle lock, kneebar, or toehold catch position  
**Win:** Successfully achieve proper catch position for ankle lock, kneebar, or toehold - do NOT apply finishing pressure

### Defending Player  
**Position:** Sitting in front of your partner with one leg entangled in their ashi garami  
**Objective:** Escape the leg entanglement and free your knee line  
**Win:** Successfully escape the ashi garami position and completely disconnect/free your leg

## Instructions
1. Attacker starts on back with ashi garami established on one of defender's legs
2. Defender starts sitting in front of attacker with leg entangled
3. Attacker works to maintain ashi garami control and set up leg attacks
4. Defender works immediately to escape the entanglement
5. Reset after successful escape or submission catch position is achieved  
6. Switch roles after predetermined time
7. **SAFETY: Focus on achieving catch positions only - do not apply finishing pressure**

## Coaching Points
For attacking player:
- Keep your top leg heavy on their thigh to control the position
- Use your bottom leg to prevent them from stepping over
- Control their ankle/heel area to set up attacks
- For ankle lock: secure ankle and heel control
- For kneebar: work to straighten their leg and get both hands around heel
- For toehold: flex their foot and achieve proper hand placement
- Do NOT apply finishing pressure - demonstrate the catch then reset
- Keep your hips close to maintain the entanglement

For defending player:
- Stay calm and work systematically to escape
- Create space by pushing on the attacker's hip or knee
- Step over the bottom leg when possible to begin escape
- Pull your knee toward your chest to help free the entanglement
- Don't ignore the position - start escaping immediately
- Protect your ankle and knee positioning during escape attempts

**Safety Reminder:** This is a catch-and-release drill. Achieve the submission position, demonstrate control, then immediately reset. Never apply finishing pressure to ankle, knee, or foot joints.
