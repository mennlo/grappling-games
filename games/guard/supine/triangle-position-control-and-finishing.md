# Triangle Position Control and Finishing

## Overview
A triangle-specific drill where the bottom player starts with a loose leg loop around the top player's head and arm. The bottom player works to maintain the position, break the top player's head down, and advance to a tight triangle, omoplata, or sweep. The top player works to escape by getting both arms in/out or freeing their head and arm completely.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your back with a closed leg loop around your partner's head and one arm (triangle not yet tightened to foot-to-knee position), with your partner's hips shelved on your quads  
**Objective:** Maintain the leg loop, break your partner's head down, and advance to a tight triangle finish, switch to omoplata and finish, or sweep and come on top  
**Win:** Successfully complete a triangle finish, omoplata setup, or sweep to dominant position

### Top Player
**Position:** On your knees with your head and one arm caught in your partner's leg loop, head up, hips shelved on your partner's quads  
**Objective:** Get both arms inside or outside the loop, or completely free your head and arm from the triangle position  
**Win:** Successfully get both arms to the same side of the triangle or completely escape the position

## Instructions

## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Focus on breaking your partner's head down first before tightening the triangle
- Use your hands to control your partner's head and arm positioning
- Angle your hips properly to create the tightest triangle possible
- If your partner gets both arms in, immediately transition to omoplata
- Look for sweep opportunities when your partner lifts their hips or changes position
- Don't rush the finish - control the position first

For top player:
- Keep your head up as long as possible to prevent the triangle from tightening
- Work systematically to get both arms to the same side
- If you can't prevent head control, focus on getting both arms inside quickly
- Drive your hips forward to reduce the angle and space for the triangle
- Don't panic - work methodically to improve your arm position
- Be aware of omoplata transitions when you get both arms inside
