## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Stay light on your feet and maintain good posture
- Use lateral movement to create angles for different target areas
- Control the bottom player's legs with your hands to create openings
- Keep your base wide when moving to access target areas
- Call out "belt" or "knee" clearly and immediately upon contact
- Don't rush - maintain balance while working for shin contact
- Be aware of the bottom player's attempts to insert their feet inside
- Mix up your targets to keep the bottom player guessing

For the bottom player:
- Work quickly to establish inside foot position before the top player gets outside
- Keep your legs active and mobile to prevent easy outside access
- Use your hands to create space and help your feet get inside
- Target both ankles simultaneously when your feet are inside
- Maintain ankle grips with both hands once established
- Use your core to help with leg movement and positioning
