## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Standing over supine partner who has their legs up  
**Objective:** Establish either a knee slice position by placing your shin across your partner's thigh, or a smash pass position with one or both of your partner's legs on your shoulders  
**Win:** Successfully establish knee slice position with shin pinning partner's thigh, or achieve smash pass position with one or both legs on shoulders and hips controlled, and maintain control for 3 seconds

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Lying on your back with legs up, ready to engage  
**Objective:** Prevent the knee slice or smash pass by establishing effective frames, hooks, or guards  
**Constraints:** Start from supine position with legs up  
**Win:** Successfully get both feet inside opponent's legs, recover closed guard, or put opponent into triangle position

## Instructions
1. Bottom player starts lying on their back with legs up in a defensive position
2. Top player starts standing, looking to enter either a knee slice or smash pass position
3. Top player works to establish either position while maintaining control
4. Bottom player works to get feet inside, recover closed guard, or establish triangle position
5. When either player achieves their win condition, switch roles
6. Reset and repeat until time expires

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Focus on controlling one of the bottom player's legs first to create an opening
- For knee slice: Keep your shin angled across their thigh, pinning it to the mat
- For smash pass: Work to elevate one or both legs to your shoulders while maintaining pressure
- Use level changes and weight shifts to create angles for entries
- Keep your posture upright to maintain balance during transitions
- Control their upper body with either an underhook or crossface to prevent them from turning into you
- Recognize when to switch between knee slice and smash pass based on the bottom player's reactions

For bottom players:
- Establish early frames with your hands and feet to prevent the top player from getting close
- Work to maintain inside position with both feet when possible
- Use your legs actively to establish closed guard when there's an opening
- Look for opportunities to secure a triangle position if the top player overcommits
- Be ready to bridge and shrimp to create space and recover position
- Focus on controlling inside space with your feet to prevent both pass variations
