- Focus on controlling both legs simultaneously
- Drive forward only after securing control of both legs

For bottom players:
- Work quickly to establish inside foot position before control is established

- Keep your core engaged to maintain seated posture
- Frame with your arms to prevent being flattened
- Look for opportunities to insert your feet when the top player shifts their weight
