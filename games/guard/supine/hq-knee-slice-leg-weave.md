## Top Player
**Position:** In Head Quarters position - kneeling with one knee between your partner's legs and the other leg posted outside, controlling their legs with pressure and grips  
**Objective:** From the HQ position, establish either a knee slice position (shin across thigh) or leg weave position (legs pinned with knees pointing away), then complete the pass to side control or mount. The pass must start from one of these positions
