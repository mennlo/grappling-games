## Coaching Points
For Guard Player:
- Use sleeve grip and lasso to control posture and distance
- Keep your other foot active on hip or bicep to maintain connection
- If losing the lasso, immediately work to re-establish it
- Look for sweep opportunities when top player is off-balance
- Keep your hips mobile to adjust angle

For Top Player:
- Work methodically to address the sleeve grip first
- Use knee pressure and posture to create space
- Control the non-lassoed leg to reduce guard player's mobility
- Stay balanced on your knees while working to pass
- Clear one connection at a time rather than rushing
