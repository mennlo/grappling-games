# Kneebar and Toehold Catch

## Overview
A leg attack drill where the attacking player starts with leg entanglement from a mounted position, then falls to the side to set up kneebar and toehold attacks, while the defender works to escape the leg entanglement and free their knee line.

**Important Safety Note:** This drill focuses on achieving the proper grip positions for submissions without applying finishing pressure. For kneebar: connect both hands around the heel with the leg straight. For toehold: connect one hand around the toes and the other hand around the heel with the foot flexed. Do NOT finish these submissions - focus on achieving the catch position only.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacking Player
**Position:** Starting sitting on defender's stomach with one of the defender's legs entangled, holding around the defender's knees  
**Objective:** Fall off to one side and maintain control of the leg(s) to transition to a kneebar or toehold catch position  
**Win:** Successfully achieve proper grip position for kneebar (both hands around heel with leg straight) or toehold (one hand on toes, one on heel with foot flexed) - do NOT apply finishing pressure

### Defending Player
**Position:** On your back with one leg entangled and controlled by the attacking player who is sitting on your stomach  
**Objective:** Escape the leg entanglement and free your knee line when the attacker falls to the side  
**Win:** Successfully escape the leg entanglement and free your knee line completely

## Instructions
1. Defender starts on their back, attacker sitting on stomach with leg entangled
2. Attacker holds around defender's knees and falls to one side
3. Attacker works to maintain leg control and achieve submission catch positions
4. Defender immediately works to escape entanglement and free their legs
5. Reset after successful escape or submission catch position is achieved
6. Switch roles after predetermined time
7. **SAFETY: Focus on achieving catch positions only - do not apply finishing pressure**

## Coaching Points
For attacking player:
- Fall to the side while maintaining leg control
- Keep the defender's leg tight to your body as you transition
- For kneebar: straighten the leg and get both hands around the heel
- For toehold: flex the foot and get proper hand placement (toes and heel)
- Do NOT apply finishing pressure - focus on achieving the catch position
- Control the hip to prevent the defender from turning into you

For defending player:
- Start escaping immediately when the attacker begins to fall
- Turn your hips away from the attacker to reduce their control
- Pull your knee to your chest to escape the entanglement
- Don't wait - explosive movement at the start is crucial
- Protect your ankle and knee positioning as you escape

**Safety Reminder:** This is a catch-and-release drill. Achieve the position, demonstrate control, then reset. Never apply finishing pressure to knee or ankle joints.
