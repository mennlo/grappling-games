## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Use your belt grip to control their posture and prevent them from creating distance
- Keep your hooks active to control their hip movement
- Pull them forward when they try to create space
- Use hip movement to stay squared up as they try to circle
- Maintain forward pressure with your chest
- Be ready to transition if they commit too hard to one side

For top players:
- Work to create space despite their belt grip
- Use hand fighting to control their hooks
- Look for opportunities to step around when they're off-balance
- Keep your base strong as you work to circle around
- Don't let them pull you into their closed guard
- Be patient and systematic in creating passing angles
- Consider standing to create different passing opportunities
