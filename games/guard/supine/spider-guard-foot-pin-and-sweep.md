## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Maintain constant tension in your sleeve grips and feet to control distance
- Use hip movement to create angles for sweeps and submissions
- Look for opportunities to move underneath your partner to establish leg connections
- When threatened with a foot pin, keep your feet active and moving

For top players:
- Focus on breaking one connection at a time rather than both simultaneously
- Use your weight and pressure strategically to pin feet
- Maintain good posture to prevent being off-balanced or swept
- Look for opportunities to use your own feet to trap and pin your partner's feet
