## Coaching Points
For Guard Player:
- Use the lasso to control posture and create angles for attacks
- For the triangle: use the lasso to pull the lasso'd shoulder tight, kick your lasso leg through and kick your free leg over the shoulder, and lock up the triangle
- For the omoplata: use the lasso to isolate the arm, swing your hips out, and thread your leg over the shoulder to attack
- Keep your sleeve grip tight to prevent posture and escape
- Use hip movement to create the angles needed for submissions
- If one attack fails, transition to the other
- The lasso naturally isolates one arm - use this to your advantage

For Top Player:
- Keep your elbows tight to prevent arm isolation
- Maintain good posture to make triangle setups difficult
- If caught in triangle, work to posture and create space
- If caught in omoplata, roll through or stack to escape
- Address the sleeve grip to reduce submission threats
- Stay balanced and avoid leaning too far forward
