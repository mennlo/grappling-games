# Standing to Knee Slice or Leg Weave Pass

## Overview
A drill where the top player starts standing at the bottom player's feet and must establish either a knee slice or leg weave type position before completing the pass. Bottom player works to prevent the position establishment and looks for sweeps or guard recovery.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Standing in front of bottom player's feet  
**Objective:** Establish either a knee slice position (shin across thigh) or leg weave position (legs pinned with knees pointing away), then complete the pass to side control or mount. The pass must start from one of these positions  
**Win:** Successfully establish knee slice or leg weave position and complete the pass to side control or mount  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Lying on your back with top player standing at your feet  
**Objective:** Prevent top player from establishing knee slice or leg weave position, or sweep when they commit  
**Win:** Get both feet on opponent's hips, recover closed guard, complete any sweep to come on top, or stand up  

## Instructions
1. Top player starts standing at the foot line of bottom player who is lying on their back
2. Top player works to enter and establish either knee slice or leg weave position
3. Top player must establish the position before attempting to complete the pass
4. Bottom player uses frames, hooks, and guards to prevent position establishment
5. Bottom player looks for sweep opportunities when top player commits to a position
6. When either player achieves their win condition, switch roles
7. Reset and repeat until time expires

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Control the legs first before committing to your passing position
- Use grips and pressure to flatten the bottom player's defensive structure
- Decide between knee slice or leg weave based on bottom player's reactions
- For knee slice: get your shin across the thigh with outside leg posted
- For leg weave: pin both legs so knees point away from you
- Maintain good posture during the entry to avoid being swept
- Don't rush the position establishment - build it systematically

For bottom players:
- Keep feet and hands between you and your partner during the entry
- Use inside connections with feet to prevent knee slice entries
- Create frames to prevent being flattened
- Look for sweep opportunities when the top player is transitioning between standing and kneeling
- Stay mobile with your hips to prevent the passer from settling into position
- If position is established, immediately work to square hips or insert hooks
- Watch for off-balancing opportunities during the standing-to-kneeling transition
