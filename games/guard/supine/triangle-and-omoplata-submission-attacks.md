For bottom player:
- Set up your attacks by creating the right grips and angles first
- Don't rush into submissions - control the position and create proper setups
- Be ready to transition between triangle and omoplata as your partner defends
- Use sweeps as secondary options when submissions aren't available
- Maintain active guard work - don't let your partner settle into defensive positions
- Focus on breaking your partner's posture to create submission opportunities

For top player:
- Recognize submission setups early and defend appropriately
- Keep good posture and hand/arm positioning to prevent easy triangles
- Be aware of omoplata setups when defending triangles
- Don't stay static - keep working toward guard passing while defending
- Use proper pressure and positioning to make submissions more difficult
- Look for opportunities to counter-attack when your partner commits to submissions
