## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Work to control and neutralize the bottom player's underhook
- Use your underhook to prevent them from turning into you
- Focus on establishing chest-to-chest contact to limit their mobility
- Be patient and methodical in breaking down their underhook structure
- Use your free hand to control their head or far arm

For bottom players:
- Use your underhook actively to create space and movement
- Look for opportunities to come up on your side or to your knees
- Use hip movement to create angles for back takes or sweeps
- Keep your underhook deep and strong to maintain control
- Look for opportunities to transition to closed guard when top player commits forward
- Use your underhook to help you stand up or take the back when opportunities arise
