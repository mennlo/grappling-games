# Half Guard Knee Shield to Submission

## Overview
A focused drill on passing half guard when the bottom player has established a knee shield, with the top player working to neutralize the frame and achieve upper body submissions from any position outside of full guard.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** In top half guard with your partner's knee shield against your torso, no upper body connection established  
**Objective:** Neutralize the knee shield, advance position, and secure an upper body submission from any position that isn't full guard  
**Win:** Finish any upper body submission (arm triangle, kimura, americana, armbar, straight armbar, etc.) from any position outside of full guard

### Bottom Player
**Position:** In half guard with knee shield established against your partner's torso  
**Objective:** Use the knee shield and movement to create space, improve your position, and look for submission opportunities  
**Win:** Get both feet on the top player's hips, establish closed guard, sweep and come on top, OR secure any submission

## Instructions
1. Top player starts in half guard with bottom player's knee shield against their torso
2. Top player has no upper body connection (no underhook, crossface, or chest-to-chest contact)
3. Top player works to neutralize the knee shield and advance to establish submission opportunities
4. Bottom player uses the knee shield to create distance and look for escape or submission opportunities
5. Top player can work for submissions from half guard, side control, mount, or any transitional position except full guard
6. Bottom player can also submit if opportunities arise during scrambles or sweeps
7. When either player achieves their win condition, reset and switch roles

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Work to control the knee shield leg to neutralize the frame
- Use pressure and angle changes to collapse the knee shield
- Once the shield is neutralized, look for submission opportunities during transitions
- Common submissions include kimuras when passing, arm triangles from side control, and armbars from mount
- Don't rush past positions - if a submission presents itself during the pass, take it
- Be patient and methodical in breaking down the knee shield structure
- Chain your passing attempts with submission threats to create reactions

For bottom players:
- Use the knee shield to maintain distance and prevent flattening
- Keep your shield active and mobile, not just static
- Look for opportunities to transition to closed guard when top player pressures forward
- Use hip movement to create angles for sweeps
- Maintain frames with your hands to support the knee shield
- Be aware of submission opportunities during scrambles or when you establish top position
- Look for guillotines, triangles from bottom, or kimuras during transitions
