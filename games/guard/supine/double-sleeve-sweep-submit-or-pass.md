## Instructions
1. Partners start with bottom player on their back, double sleeve grips, and feet on the hips; top player on knees, controlling shins
2. If the bottom player sweeps, submits, or stands up, or if the top player passes and establishes control, reset and switch roles

## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Use your grips and feet to off-balance
- Transition between sweeps, submissions, and technical stand-ups
- Maintain tension in the sleeves to control posture and distance

For top players:
- Use your hands to strip grips and control the shins or feet
- Work to clear the feet from your hips before standing or passing
- Look for opportunities to pin the hips and establish dominant control
