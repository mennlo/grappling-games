## Instructions
1. Partners start with bottom player on their back in lasso guard (one leg lassoed, sleeve grip, other foot on hip/bicep); top player on knees
2. If the bottom player sweeps, submits, or stands up, or if the top player passes and establishes control, reset and switch roles

## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Use your lasso and foot on the hip to create angles and off-balance your partner
- Transition between sweeps, submissions, and technical stand-ups
- Maintain strong sleeve and lasso connections to control posture and distance

For top players:
- Use your hands and movement to strip grips and remove the lasso
- Work to clear the lasso and break the sleeve grip before passing
- Look for opportunities to pin the hips and establish dominant control
