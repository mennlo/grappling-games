## Overview
A focused drill on passing half guard from an over-the-hips control position, with the top player working to advance position and achieve upper body submissions from any position outside of full guard.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** In top half guard with your arms hugging over the top of your partner's hips  
**Objective:** Maintain hip control, advance position, and secure an upper body submission from any position that isn't full guard  
**Win:** Finish any upper body submission (arm triangle, kimura, americana, armbar, straight armbar, etc.) from any top position outside of full guard

### Bottom Player
**Position:** In half guard on your side with your partner hugging over the top of your hips  
**Objective:** Use movement and frames to create space, improve your position, and look for submission opportunities  
**Win:** Get both feet on the top player's hips, establish closed guard, sweep and come on top, OR secure any submission

## Instructions
1. Top player starts in half guard with arms hugging over the top of bottom player's hips
2. Top player works to maintain hip control while advancing to establish submission opportunities
3. Bottom player uses movement and framing to create space and look for escape or submission opportunities
4. Top player can work for submissions from half guard, side control, mount, or any transitional position except full guard
5. Bottom player can also submit if opportunities arise during scrambles or sweeps
6. When either player achieves their win condition, reset and switch roles

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Maintain tight hip control with your over-the-hips grip
- Use your weight and pressure to prevent bottom player from creating space
- Look for submission opportunities as you transition between positions
- Common submissions include kimuras when passing, arm triangles from side control, and armbars from mount
- Don't rush past positions - if a submission presents itself during the pass, take it
- Be patient and methodical in advancing your position
- Chain your passing attempts with submission threats to create reactions

For bottom players:
- Use your frames and hip movement to prevent being flattened
- Work to create space between your hips and your partner's chest
- Look for opportunities to transition to closed guard when top player commits to passing
- Use hip escapes to create angles for sweeps
- Keep your hands active to prevent upper body control
- Be aware of submission opportunities during scrambles or when you establish top position
- Look for guillotines, triangles from bottom, or kimuras during transitions
