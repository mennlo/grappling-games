### Top Player
**Position:** In half guard but facing toward your partner's hips, with your hips positioned inside their elbows  
**Objective:** Flatten your opponent to their back, create chest to chest contact, and establish an underhook  
**Win:** Free your trapped knee and touch the mat with your knee on either side of their hips while maintaining chest-to-chest position and an underhook

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your side in half guard with your partner facing toward your hips, their hips inside your elbows  
**Objective:** Use movement and frames to create space and improve your position

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Use your hip position inside their elbows to create leverage
- Work to flatten them while maintaining your advantageous angle
- Focus on establishing an underhook from this position

For bottom players:
- Use your frames to prevent being flattened despite the awkward angle
