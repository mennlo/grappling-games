## Coaching Points
For Guard Player:
- Use sleeve grip and lasso to control posture and distance
- Adjust your lasso tension when top player stands
- Keep your other foot active to maintain connection
- If losing the lasso, immediately work to re-establish it
- Look for sweep opportunities when top player changes levels
- Be aware of leg drag and stack passing threats when they stand

For Top Player:
- Work methodically to address the sleeve grip first
- Use standing posture to create pressure and angles
- Time your stand-up to create passing opportunities
- Control the non-lassoed leg to reduce guard player's mobility
- Clear one connection at a time before committing to the pass
- Use leg drags, stack passes, or knee cuts once the lasso is cleared
