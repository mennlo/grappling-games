# Seated Guard Leg Connection Control

## Overview
A dynamic drill where an attacker in seated guard maintains connection to a standing defender's leg, working to off-balance and entangle for takedowns or sweeps, while the defender tries to flatten the attacker and maintain control.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacker
**Position:** Seated in guard position (sit-up or shin-on-shin) with connection to one of the defender's legs  
**Objective:** Off-balance the defender, elevate or entangle the leg, and transition to a takedown or sweep to become the top player  
**Win:** Successfully complete a takedown or sweep to become the top player

### Defender
**Position:** Standing with one leg connected/controlled by the seated attacker  
**Objective:** Flatten the attacker onto their back and keep them flat for 3 seconds  
**Win:** Successfully flatten the attacker and maintain them on their back for 3+ seconds

## Instructions
1. Attacker starts in seated guard position with connection to defender's leg
2. Defender works to control distance and flatten the attacker
3. Attacker uses leg connection to off-balance and create takedown opportunities
4. Both players reset if there is complete disconnection between them
5. Reset after takedown completion or successful flattening
6. Switch roles after the predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For attacker:
- Maintain active connection to the defender's leg at all times
- Use your legs and grips to create off-balance and elevation
- Look for opportunities to entangle the leg when the defender commits to flattening
- Time your takedown attempts when the defender is off-balance
- Keep your back off the mat - use your core to stay in seated position

For defender:
- Control the distance to prevent easy leg entanglements
- Use your free leg and hand placement to create downward pressure
- Don't overcommit to flattening - maintain your balance
- Look for opportunities to step back and break the connection
- Keep your posture strong to avoid being pulled down
