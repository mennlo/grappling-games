# Seated Guard Leg Connection Control

## Overview
A dynamic drill where an attacker in seated guard maintains connection to a standing defender's leg, working to off-balance and entangle for takedowns or sweeps, while the defender tries to flatten the attacker and maintain control.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacker
**Position:** Seated in guard position (sit-up or shin-on-shin) with connection to one of the defender's legs  
**Objective:** Off-balance the defender, elevate or entangle the leg, and transition to a takedown or sweep to become the top player  
**Win:** Successfully complete a takedown or sweep to become the top player

### Defender
**Position:** Standing with one leg connected/controlled by the seated attacker  
**Objective:** Pass the guard by getting around the attacker or completely disconnect from the attacker  
**Win:** Successfully pass the guard or achieve complete disconnection from the attacker

## Instructions
1. Attacker starts in seated guard position with connection to defender's leg
2. Defender works to pass guard or completely disconnect
3. Attacker uses leg connection to off-balance and create takedown opportunities
4. Reset after takedown/sweep completion or successful guard pass/disconnection
5. Switch roles after the predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For attacker:
- Maintain active connection to the defender's leg at all times
- Use your legs and grips to create off-balance and elevation
- Look for opportunities to entangle the leg when the defender commits to flattening
- Time your takedown attempts when the defender is off-balance
- Keep your back off the mat - use your core to stay in seated position

For defender:
- Work to get around the attacker (pass guard) or create distance to disconnect
- Control the distance to prevent easy leg entanglements
- Use your free leg and hand placement to create angles for passing
- Don't get drawn into the attacker's game - stay focused on your objectives
- Look for opportunities to step back and break the connection cleanly
- Keep your posture strong and mobile to avoid being pulled down
