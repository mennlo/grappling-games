# Split and Chest-to-Chest

## Overview
A drill focusing on splitting the opponent's guard and achieving chest-to-chest connection with one leg inside (splitting the partner's legs), rather than fully passing. This game develops the ability to open the guard, control the legs, and establish strong passing positions, while the bottom player works on guard retention.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners - switching back and forth  

### Top Player
**Position:** On your knees, facing your partner's supine guard. No grips at the start.  
**Objective:** Split your partner's legs using your body or grips (after the start), and achieve chest-to-chest connection with one leg inside, splitting your partner's legs.  
**Constraints:** Must initiate by splitting the legs before connecting chest-to-chest. No cloth grips allowed. Not trying to fully pass.  
**Win:** Achieve chest-to-chest connection with one leg inside, splitting your partner's legs.  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Supine, feet on the inside between your partner's legs. No grips at the start.  
**Objective:** Retain guard by keeping your feet between your partner's legs at all times. Use hooks, frames, and movement to prevent the top player from achieving chest-to-chest.  
**Constraints:** Only goal is to retain guard and keep feet between the top player's legs. No cloth grips allowed.  
**Win:** Keep your feet between your partner's legs for the duration of the round (no sweeps or submissions).

## Instructions
1. Partners start with bottom player supine, feet on the inside between the top player's knees; top player on knees, facing the guard. Neither player starts with grips, but can form grips after the start (no cloth grips allowed).
2. Top player works to split the legs and achieve chest-to-chest connection with one leg inside; bottom player works to retain guard and keep their feet between the top player's legs.
3. If the top player achieves chest-to-chest with one leg inside, or the bottom player loses both feet between the legs, reset and switch roles.

- Use your body and grips to split the legs and create a path to chest-to-chest (no cloth grips)
- Control the legs before moving chest-to-chest
- Focus on establishing strong chest-to-chest connection with one leg inside, not fully passing

For bottom players:
- Use hooks, frames, and movement to keep your feet between your partner's legs
- Focus on guard retention, not sweeps or submissions
