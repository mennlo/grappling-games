# Spider Guard Prevention and Control

## Overview
A guard passing drill where the bottom player attempts to establish spider guard (either with sleeve grips and feet on biceps, or feet inside thighs with ankle/pant grips), while the top player works to prevent this and establish an HQ or outside camping position.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Seated guard position  
**Objective:** Establish either a full spider guard with sleeve grips and feet on the biceps, or two feet on the inside of your partner's thighs with ankle/pant grips  
**Constraints:**  
**Win:** Successfully establish either spider guard variation  

### Top Player
**Position:** Standing, disconnected from the bottom player  
**Objective:** Prevent the bottom player from establishing spider guard and work to achieve an HQ camping position or outside both legs camping the hips  
**Constraints:** No finishing the pass to chest-to-chest; focus on controlling the hip line  
**Win:** None (focus is on maintaining hip line control as long as possible)  

## Instructions
1. Bottom player starts in a seated guard position, top player standing and disconnected
2. Bottom player works to establish grips and leg connections for spider guard variations
3. Top player works to prevent these connections and establish a controlling position
4. If bottom player achieves their guard position, reset and continue
5. Switch roles after the time period

## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Move quickly to establish grips before the top player can prevent them
- Keep active feet, ready to connect to biceps or inside thighs
- If one connection is blocked, immediately work for the alternative
- Use hip movement and frames to create space for guard establishment

For top players:
- Focus on grip prevention and breaking as your first priority
- Use level changes and misdirection to avoid predictable entries
- When controlling the hip line, maintain downward pressure while staying mobile
- Practice quick transitions between HQ position and outside leg control
