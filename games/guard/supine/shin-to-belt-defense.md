## Coaching Points
For the bottom player:
- Use your feet on the belt to control distance and prevent easy outside access
- Keep your ankle grip strong to limit the top player's movement
- Use your sleeve/collar grip to pull and off-balance when they try to go outside
- Keep your legs active and mobile to track the top player's movement
- Don't let your legs get split or controlled
- Use hip movement to maintain proper angle and prevent outside access

For the top player:
- Stay light on your feet and create angles to access the outside
- Use grip fighting to break or control the bottom player's hand grips
- Create lateral movement to find openings to get outside the legs
- Be patient and set up your outside access rather than forcing it
- Maintain good posture to avoid being off-balanced
- Once you get outside, quickly establish shin to belt contact
- Use hand control on the legs to create openings for outside access
