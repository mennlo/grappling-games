# Knee Slice, Leg Weave, or X Pass Drill

## Overview
A drill starting from knee slice position with knee shield where the top player must commit to one of three passing options: knee slice, leg weave, or X pass. The bottom player defends and looks for guard recovery or sweeps.

## Details

### Top Player
**Position:** Upright in knee slice position with your shin across bottom player's thigh, outside leg posted, while bottom player has a knee shield established  
**Objective:** Break down the knee shield and commit to completing the pass using either knee slice, leg weave (pinning legs so knees point away), or X pass. Complete the pass to side control or mount  
**Win:** Successfully complete the pass to side control or mount after committing to one of the three passing options  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your back and side with knee shield established against top player who is in knee slice position  
**Objective:** Maintain knee shield, prevent the pass, and look for opportunities to recover guard or sweep  
**Win:** Get both feet on opponent's hips, recover closed guard, complete any sweep to come on top, or stand up  

## Instructions
1. Top player starts upright in knee slice position with shin across bottom player's thigh and outside leg posted
2. Bottom player has knee shield established
3. Top player works to break down the knee shield and commit to one of three passing options
4. Once committed to a passing option (knee slice, leg weave, or X pass), top player works to complete the pass
5. Bottom player maintains defensive frames and looks for opportunities to recover guard or sweep

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Be decisive in choosing your passing option based on how the bottom player reacts
- For knee slice: drive your knee across while maintaining chest pressure
- For leg weave: pin the legs so knees point away from you, maintain weight on top leg
- For X pass: control the far hip and near leg, step over to complete the pass
- Maintain good posture and base throughout the transition
- Don't switch between passing options once committed

For bottom players:
- Use knee shield actively to create frames and prevent forward pressure
- Keep your hips mobile to prevent being flattened
- Watch for opportunities to insert hooks when the passer commits
- Look for sweep opportunities when the passer's weight shifts
- Maintain connection with your frames to prevent chest-to-chest contact
- If knee shield is broken, immediately work to square hips or insert hooks
