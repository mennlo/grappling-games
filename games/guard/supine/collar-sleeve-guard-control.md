## Coaching Points
For bottom player:
- Keep active feet on your partner's hips or belt to maintain distance and control
- Use the collar grip to break posture and control head position
- Use the sleeve grip to prevent posting and control arm positioning
- Look for opportunities to transition to triangle when your partner tries to break grips
- When attempting sweeps, use your grips for leverage and timing

For top player:
- Maintain good posture to limit your partner's effectiveness with collar control
- Systematically work to break grips - don't try to break both at once
- Use careful pressure and angles to defeat the grips
- Look for opportunities to drive your knee through to establish half guard
- Keep your elbows close to your body to make it harder for your partner to control your arms
