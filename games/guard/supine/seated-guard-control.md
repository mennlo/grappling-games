## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Keep your hips active and mobile
- Use your grips to pull your partner forward and off-balance
- Look for opportunities to shoot for a single leg when your partner's posture is broken
- Use your head position to help drive through on the single leg
- Be persistent with hand fighting to create openings

For top players:
- Maintain good posture to prevent being pulled forward
- Use head pressure and grips to control your partner's upper body
- Keep your base wide to prevent being off-balanced
- Control your partner's sleeve or collar to limit their ability to grab your legs
- Apply pressure gradually rather than with sudden movements
