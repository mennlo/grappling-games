# Split and Pass

## Overview
A drill focusing on splitting the opponent's guard and passing from a kneeling position. This game develops the ability to open the guard, control the legs, and transition to dominant passing positions, while the bottom player works on guard retention.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners - switching back and forth  

### Top Player
**Position:** On your knees, facing your partner's supine guard. No grips at the start.  
**Objective:** Split your partner's legs using your body or grips (after the start), control the legs, and pass to achieve chest-to-chest or chest-to-back with a head and arm  
**Constraints:** Must initiate by splitting the legs before passing. No cloth grips allowed.  
**Win:** Successfully pass the guard and establish chest-to-chest or chest-to-back with a head and arm  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Supine, feet on the inside between your partner's legs. No grips at the start.  
**Objective:** Retain guard by keeping your feet between your partner's legs at all times. Use hooks, frames, and movement to prevent the pass.  
**Constraints:** Only goal is to retain guard and keep feet between the top player's legs. No cloth grips allowed.  
**Win:** Keep your feet between your partner's legs for the duration of the round (no sweeps or submissions).
