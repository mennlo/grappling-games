# Smash Pass Elevated Hips Drill

## Overview
A guard passing drill where the top player starts with a smash pass position (one leg on shoulder, other leg pinned), and must pass to chest-to-chest control only when the bottom player's hips are elevated. The bottom player works to recover guard, turtle, or achieve triangle position.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** On knees with one of bottom player's legs on your shoulder and the other leg pinned (either with your leg or hand)  
**Objective:** Pass guard to achieve chest-to-chest control, but only when bottom player's hips are elevated off the mat  
**Win:** Successfully achieve chest-to-chest control after passing the guard while bottom player's hips are elevated  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Lying on your back with one leg on top player's shoulder and other leg pinned  
**Objective:** Recover guard, transition to turtle position, or put top player in triangle position  
**Win:** Successfully recover guard, establish turtle position, or achieve triangle control  

## Instructions
1. Top player starts on their knees with one of bottom player's legs on their shoulder and the other leg pinned
2. Top player works to create situations where bottom player's hips elevate off the mat
3. When hips are elevated, top player attempts to pass to chest-to-chest control
4. Bottom player works to recover guard, transition to turtle, or establish triangle position
5. When either player achieves their win condition, switch roles
6. Reset and repeat until time expires

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Use controlled pressure to encourage the bottom player to elevate their hips
- Be patient and wait for the right moment to pass when the hips elevate
- Maintain good base and posture to prevent being caught in triangle positions
- Control the pinned leg firmly while preparing to pass
- Once hips are elevated, move quickly but with control to establish chest-to-chest position
- Focus on timing your pass with the bottom player's defensive movements

For bottom players:
- Try to keep your hips on the mat while working escapes
- Use frames to create space for guard recovery
- Look for opportunities to transition to turtle when pressure becomes too intense
- Be aware of your leg position to set up potential triangle opportunities
- Use bridging and shrimping movements strategically, being mindful of when your hips leave the mat
- Focus on maintaining connection and control with your free leg
