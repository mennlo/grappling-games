## Instructions

## Coaching Points
For the bottom player:
- Use your free leg actively to create sweep opportunities
- Work to get your controlled foot out of the "pocket" position
- If going for ankle grips, focus on getting both feet inside simultaneously
- For bicep control, establish sleeve grips before placing feet
- Use hip movement to create angles for sweeps
- Don't let your knees get completely turned away

For the top player:
- Maintain the pants grip while working to turn their knees away
- Use your hip to keep their foot shelved while establishing control
- Focus on getting behind their knee line to establish leg drag
- Control their hips with your free hand once in position
- Keep pressure to prevent them from turning back towards you
- Be aware of sweep attempts while transitioning to leg drag
