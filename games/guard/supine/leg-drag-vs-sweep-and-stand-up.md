## Coaching Points
For the bottom player:
- Use your ankle grip to control distance and prevent easy leg control
- Keep your feet active on the belt line to create sweep opportunities
- Use your sleeve/collar grip to off-balance when attempting sweeps
- If attempting to stand up, maintain grips while posting up
- Don't let your legs get isolated or controlled
- Use hip movement to stay mobile and create angles for sweeps
- Transition between sweep attempts and standing attempts

For the top player:
- Focus on isolating one leg rather than trying to control both
- Use grip fighting to break or control the bottom player's hand grips
- Create angles to access the leg drag position
- Once you have leg control, work to get your hips outside their guard
- Follow through to establish full chest contact after achieving leg drag
- Use your free hand to control their upper body during the pass
- Be aware of sweep attempts while working for the complete pass
- Don't stop at leg drag position - complete the pass to chest contact
