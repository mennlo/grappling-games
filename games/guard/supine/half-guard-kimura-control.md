# Half Guard Kimura Control

## Overview
A focused drill on controlling and passing half guard using kimura grip control, where the top player must first establish the kimura grip and then use that control to either finish the submission or facilitate the pass.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** In half guard with your hips positioned inside their elbows, similar to hip-facing position  
**Objective:** Establish a kimura grip on your partner's arm and use that control to either finish the submission or pass the guard  
**Constraints:** Must connect to the kimura grip before attempting to pass or submit  
**Win:** Finish the kimura submission, OR free your trapped leg and establish side control or better while maintaining the kimura grip

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your side in half guard with your partner's hips inside your elbows  
**Objective:** Prevent the kimura grip and work to improve your position using movement and frames  
**Win:** Get both feet on the top player's hips, establish closed guard, sweep and come on top (must not be in submission)

## Instructions
1. Top player starts in half guard positioned with hips inside the bottom player's elbows
2. Top player's first priority is to establish the kimura grip on the near arm
3. Once kimura grip is established, top player can work to either finish the submission or use the control to pass
4. Bottom player works to prevent the kimura grip connection and maintain defensive frames
5. If bottom player prevents the grip, top player must continue working for it
6. When either player achieves their win condition, reset and switch roles

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Use your hip position to create pressure and make it difficult for them to defend their arm
- Be patient in establishing the kimura grip - don't rush
- Once you have the grip, use it to flatten your opponent and control their movement
- The kimura grip gives you excellent control for passing - use it to prevent them from creating frames
- If the submission is available, take it, but don't force it if they're well defended
- Keep your weight forward to prevent being swept once you have the kimura

For bottom players:
- Keep your arms in safe positions - avoid reaching or extending them
- Use your frames and leg position to prevent being flattened
- If they get the kimura grip, immediately work to address it by turning into them or getting to your knees
- Look for opportunities to off-balance the top player when they commit to the kimura
- Use hip movement to create space and recover better position
- Don't neglect your half guard hook - it's your primary defensive tool
