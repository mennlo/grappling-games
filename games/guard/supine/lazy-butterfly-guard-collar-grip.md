## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Use your collar grip to control their posture and create angles
- The foot on their thigh creates distance and controls their hips
- The threaded foot can be used to off-balance or transition to full butterfly
- Look for opportunities to come up on your elbow or sit up to improve position
- Use hip movement to stay perpendicular and create sweeping angles
- Watch for submission opportunities when they reach to pass

For top players:
- Work to control the leg on your thigh to reduce their mobility
- Be careful of their collar grip pulling you into submissions
- Stay centered and maintain good base on your knees
- Look for opportunities to clear the threaded foot
- Keep your free arm ready to post and maintain balance
- Be patient and systematic in your passing approach while staying on your knees
