3. For knee slice: drive knee across the thigh while maintaining chest pressure
4. For weave pass: get shoulder into the leg with knee smashed down, maintain weight on weave arm
5. For leg weave smash: pin both legs so knees point away, maintain weight on top leg

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Be decisive in choosing your passing option based on bottom player's reactions
- For knee slice: keep chest pressure forward as you drive your knee across
- For weave pass: maintain weight on your weave arm with shoulder pressure into the leg
- For leg weave smash: pin the legs so knees point away from you, control leg positioning
- Don't switch between passing options once you've committed
- Maintain good posture and base throughout the transition
- Be patient and systematic in breaking down the knee shield first

For bottom players:
- Use knee shield actively to create frames and prevent forward pressure
- Keep your upper body away from your partner at all costs
- Create frames to prevent upper body connection from the passer
- If knee shield is broken, immediately work to square hips or insert hooks
- Look for loop choke opportunities when passer commits to weave pass
- Stay alert for sweep opportunities when the passer's base is compromised
- Use hip movement and bridging to create escape opportunities
- Maintain hip mobility to prevent being flattened completely
- Work to get both feet inside and control ankles when possible
