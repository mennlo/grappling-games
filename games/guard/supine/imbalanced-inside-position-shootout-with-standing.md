For bottom player:
- Use single leg X position to off-balance the standing player
- Control the trapped leg with your legs and work to elevate it
- Look for opportunities to trip or sweep when the top player is off-balance
- Once you take them down, quickly work to establish hip connection
- Secure ankle wrap with your arm - not just leg control
- Be patient and systematic - both parts of the win condition are required

For top player:
- Stay mobile and don't let the bottom player settle into their grips
- Work to strip the leg connections by creating angles and distance
- Use your free leg to create base and prevent takedowns
- Look for opportunities to step around the guard when connections are loose
- Don't panic - focus on systematic grip breaking and positioning
- Once connections are stripped, work quickly to pass guard
