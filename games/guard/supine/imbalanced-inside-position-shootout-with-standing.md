# Imbalanced Inside Position Shootout with Standing Option

## Overview
An advanced leg entanglement drill where one player starts with inside position advantage while both players work to either stand up clean or establish dominant grounded control with hip attachment and ankle wrap.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Both Players
**Position:** Both seated, with the attacker having inside position with their legs and both players holding their partner's ankles  
**Objective:** Get up to standing position without legs entangled, OR get attached to opponent's hip and wrap their ankle with your arm while both players remain grounded  
**Win:** Successfully stand up with legs completely free of entanglement, OR achieve hip attachment with ankle wrap while remaining seated/grounded

## Instructions
1. Attacker starts with inside position, both players hold each other's ankles
2. Both players can work toward either win condition simultaneously
3. Standing win requires complete separation - no leg entanglements remaining
4. Grounded win requires hip connection AND ankle wrap with the arm
5. Players must be completely standing (not just up on knees) for standing win
6. Reset after each successful win condition
7. Switch starting positions after predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For both players:
- Choose your strategy based on your opponent's actions
- If going for standing: work systematically to untangle legs first
- If going for ground control: secure hip attachment before working ankle wrap
- Use ankle grips to control your opponent's movement options
- Don't rush - both win conditions require complete execution
- Be ready to switch between standing and grounding strategies
- Hip attachment must be secure and ankle wrap must be with the arm, not just legs

For player with inside position advantage:
- Use your positional advantage to control the pace
- Look for opportunities to improve your position before opponent can stand

For player starting at disadvantage:
- Work quickly to either escape to standing or improve your position
- Don't panic - focus on systematic movement
