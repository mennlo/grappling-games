## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Use leverage and controlled pressure to elevate the hips
- Keep your arms tight around the thighs to maintain control
- Drive forward and upward to lift the hips off the mat
- Once hips are elevated, work to pin the legs to one side
- Be aware of potential guillotine and triangle attempts
- Keep your posture and base strong to prevent sweeps
- Control the timing of your forward pressure to avoid being rolled
- Once you begin the pin, commit to completing the pass

For bottom players:
- Use your hands on their wrists to maintain distance and control
- Keep your hips heavy on the ground as long as possible
- Look for opportunities to use their forward momentum against them with sweeps
- Frame against their shoulders or head to create space
- Work to get one leg free first to create escape opportunities
- Be ready to attack with guillotines when they drive forward
- Use bridging and hip movement to create angles for escape
- Look for triangle opportunities if they posture up or extend their arms
