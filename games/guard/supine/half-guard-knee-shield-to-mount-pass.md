## Instructions
1. Top player starts in half guard with bottom player's knee shield against their torso
2. Top player has no upper body connection (no underhook, crossface, or chest-to-chest contact)
3. Top player works to neutralize the knee shield and pass to mount
4. Bottom player uses the knee shield to create distance and look for escape opportunities
5. Top player seeks to establish mount position while bottom player defends and counters
6. When either player achieves their win condition, switch roles

## Coaching Points
For top players:
- Work to control the knee shield leg to neutralize the frame
- Use pressure and angle changes to collapse the knee shield
- Once the shield is neutralized, work to establish chest-to-chest contact
- Focus on maintaining balance while advancing to mount
- Be patient and methodical in breaking down the knee shield structure

For bottom players:
- Use the knee shield to maintain distance and prevent flattening
- Keep your shield active and mobile, not just static
- Look for opportunities to transition to closed guard when top player pressures forward
- Use hip movement to create angles for sweeps
- Maintain frames with your hands to support the knee shield
