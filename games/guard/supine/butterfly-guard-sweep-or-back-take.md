## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Use your arm control to break their posture and create angles
- Time your sweeps with their weight shifts
- Keep your hooks active and ready to elevate
- If they stand, maintain foot connection and continue off-balancing
- Look for back take opportunities when they react to sweep attempts
- Use your grips to control their upper body throughout

For top players:
- Work systematically to strip grips before attempting to pass
- Maintain good base and posture to prevent being swept
- If standing up, be ready to defend sweeps while maintaining balance
- Look for opportunities to split the legs when they commit to sweeps
- Keep your hips away from their hooks to reduce leverage
- Stay calm and patient when defending sweep attempts
