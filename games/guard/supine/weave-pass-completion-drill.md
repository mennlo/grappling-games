# Weave Pass Completion Drill

## Overview
A drill focusing on completing the weave pass from an established position where the top player has their knee smashed down. The top player works to achieve chest-to-chest or chest-to-back control while the bottom player defends and looks for escapes.

### Top Player

**Objective:** Complete the weave pass by achieving chest-to-chest or chest-to-back control. Maintain weight on your weave arm and keep shoulder pressure into the leg  
**Win:** Successfully achieve chest-to-chest or chest-to-back control  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your back with one knee smashed down by top player's weave pass

- Maintain proper hand placement to control the position
- Be patient and systematic in your passing approach

For bottom players:
- Keep your upper body away from your partner at all costs

- Use hip movement and bridging to create escape opportunities
- Stay alert for sweep opportunities when the passer's base is compromised
