## Coaching Points
For head position players:
- First priority is establishing head to neck connection
- Use hand fighting to create openings for head position
- Once head is connected, maintain the connection while setting up single leg
- Level change while keeping head connected to access the leg
- Drive through the single leg pickup to secure the win
- Keep your head tight to their neck throughout the entire sequence
- Use your hands to clear their defenses before dropping for the single

For underhook players:
- Keep your hands active to prevent head connection
- Frame with your hands to create distance when they attempt head position
- If they get head position, immediately work for the underhook
- Use sprawling motion to defend single leg attempts while maintaining balance
- Look for opportunities to slip your arm under for the underhook during their transitions
- Stay mobile and change levels to create underhook opportunities
- Be especially alert when they change levels for single leg attempts
