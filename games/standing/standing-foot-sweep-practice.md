# Standing Movement Control and Crack Stepping

## Overview
An asymmetric standing drill where one player works to control their partner's movement by positioning themselves at the "top of the triangle" between their opponent's legs, forcing them to step forward and backward across cracks or lines on the mat.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Active Player
**Position:** Standing facing your partner with collar and sleeve grip established  
**Objective:** Position yourself at the "top of the triangle" between your partner's legs and use push/pull movements to force them to step forward and backward across cracks or lines on the mat  
**Win:** Successfully force your partner to step on a crack or line on the mat  

### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing facing your partner with collar and sleeve grip established
**Objective:** Maintain your foot positioning and avoid stepping on cracks or lines while staying engaged  
**Win:** Avoid stepping on any cracks or lines for the full 3 minutes  

## Instructions
1. Active player establishes grips and positions themselves between partner's legs
2. Active player imagines a triangle with their partner's feet as the base - they want to stand at the top point
3. Active player uses push and pull movements to force partner to step forward and backward
4. Defending player tries to maintain foot positioning while staying engaged
5. Reset when active player achieves a win or time expires
6. Switch roles after 3 minutes

## Coaching Points
For active player:
- Keep yourself positioned between your partner's legs (top of the triangle)
- Use alternating push and pull movements to create momentum
- Focus on timing - when they step forward, pull; when they step back, push
- Keep your partner constantly moving and off-balance
- Use your grips to control their upper body while focusing on foot placement

For defending player:
- Use small adjustment steps rather than big movements
- Keep your base wide and stable
- Resist the push/pull timing by staying centered
- Don't get drawn into the rhythm of forward/backward movement
