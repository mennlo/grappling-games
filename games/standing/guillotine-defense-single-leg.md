# Guillotine Defense vs Single Leg Takedown

**Time:** 3 minutes per partner (6 minutes total)

## Overview
A drilling exercise where partners alternate between defending a single leg takedown using a guillotine choke grip and sacrifice throw, and attacking with a single leg while defending against the guillotine counter.

## Attacking Player
**Position:** Controlling your partner's leg in a head-inside single leg configuration, with your head on their chest and arms controlling the captured leg  
**Objective:** Maintain single leg control while defending against the guillotine counter. If thrown, tuck your chin for safety and try to scramble on top  
**Win:** Successfully complete any takedown finish, or defend the sacrifice throw and maintain top position

## Defending Player
**Position:** Standing on one leg with your partner controlling your other leg in a head-inside single leg  
**Objective:** Wrap your arm around your partner's neck, secure the guillotine grip with your other hand, and pull their head tight to your chest. Either finish the guillotine submission from standing, or execute a sacrifice throw by squatting down and falling to the side while maintaining the choke. Alternatively, disconnect and escape the single leg  
**Win:** Submit your partner with the guillotine choke, or escape the single leg (either by disconnecting fully or via sacrifice throw)

## Safety Notes
- Attacking player must be aware of neck pressure and tap early to avoid injury
- Defending player should apply the choke gradually to give partner time to defend or tap
- Start at controlled pace to ensure both partners understand the rolling mechanics
- Release the guillotine grip immediately upon tap
