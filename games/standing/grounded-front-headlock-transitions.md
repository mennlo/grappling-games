For controlling players:
- Keep constant pressure on the head with your chest and chin strap grip
- Use your hips to block your partner's attempts to turn into you
- Focus on smooth transitions while maintaining head control
- Keep your weight centered over your partner during transitions

For defending players:
- Look for moments during transitions when pressure is reduced to initiate your escape
- Frame with your arms to create space for your legs to come through
- Use hip movement and shrimping to create angles for guard recovery
- Time your guard recovery attempts with your partner's transitions
