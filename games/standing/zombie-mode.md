## Coaching Points
For the attacking player:
- Focus on changing levels and angles to find openings
- Use feints and direction changes to create opportunities
- Be persistent but controlled in your forward pressure
- Keep your arms relatively straight to maintain the "zombie" position

For the defending player:
- Focus on hand-fighting fundamentals - parries, redirects, and wrist control
- Stay light on your feet to adjust your position without backing up too far
- Practice efficient energy use - small movements are better than large ones
- Keep your hands active but don't overcommit to any single defensive action
- Maintain good defensive posture throughout the drill
