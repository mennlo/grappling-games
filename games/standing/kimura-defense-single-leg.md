# Kimura Defense vs Single Leg Takedown

**Time:** 3 minutes per partner (6 minutes total)

## Overview
A drilling exercise where partners alternate between defending a single leg takedown using a kimura grip and sacrifice throw, and attacking with a single leg while defending against the kimura counter.

## Attacking Player
**Position:** Controlling your partner's leg in a head-inside single leg configuration, with your head on their chest and arms controlling the captured leg  
**Objective:** Maintain single leg control while defending against the kimura counter. When thrown, tuck your chin and roll safely to protect your neck  
**Win:** Successfully complete any single leg takedown finish, or defend the sacrifice throw and maintain top position

## Defending Player
**Position:** Standing on one leg with your partner controlling your other leg in a head-inside single leg  
**Objective:** Push your partner's head towards the outside, reach both arms to the nearside, and connect a kimura grip. Hop closer, squat down, and execute a sacrifice throw so your partner rolls over and lands on their back. After the throw, turn to come on top while maintaining kimura control if possible  
**Win:** Successfully execute the sacrifice throw and come on top, or escape the single leg with or without maintaining the kimura grip

## Safety Notes
- Attacking player must tuck their chin and roll properly during the sacrifice throw to protect their neck
- Start at controlled pace to ensure both partners understand the rolling mechanics
- Tap early if the kimura creates discomfort
