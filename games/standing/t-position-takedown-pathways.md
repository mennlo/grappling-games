# T-Position to Bodylock Lift

## Overview
A standing drill focusing on transitioning from a T-position underhook to dominant body control. The attacker looks to secure a bodylock (front or back), pick up a single leg, pick up a double leg, or achieve tight hip-to-hip connection and lift the defender off the ground. The defender works to deny body connection and choose one of three tactical branches: re-pummel to double inside, create full separation, or redirect to their own front headlock.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth  

### Attacking Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with an underhook on your partner  
**Objective:** Progress from underhook T-position to either (1) bodylock (front or back), (2) double leg pickup, (3) single leg pickup, or (4) tight hip-to-hip elevation  
**Constraints:** No throws beyond controlled elevation; partner must land safely with feet under them  
**Win:** (a) Secure a bodylock (front or back), OR (b) successfully pick up a double leg, OR (c) successfully pick up a single leg, OR (d) drive the back of your hips into the front of defender's hips and lift opponent so both their feet briefly leave the mat

### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing in T-position with overhook and partial torso control defense  
**Objective:** Prevent bodylock, single leg, double leg, or hip-to-hip elevation while pursuing: (1) double inside control, (2) complete separation, or (3) front headlock redirection  
**Constraints:** Stay upright (no intentional dropping to knees)  
**Win:** (a) Establish double inside control (clear attacker underhook; both arms inside), OR (b) achieve complete separation (no chest/hip contact and attacker loses underhook), OR (c) secure front headlock before attacker lifts

## Instructions
1. Start in T-position: attacker underhook, defender overhook. Neutral head position.
2. Attacker angles in with outside step + head/shoulder pressure to close hip space.
3. Attacker commits to one of four pathways: bodylock connection, single leg attack, double leg attack, or hip-wedge elevation.
4. Defender selects lane early: pummel (double inside), frame & retreat (separation), or rotate underhook side into front headlock.
5. Round ends on attacker win (any of the four pathways) or defender lane success; reset immediately.
6. Switch roles after the time period.
