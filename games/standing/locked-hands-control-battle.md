## Coaching Points
For the upper body controller:
- Use level changes to create angles for upper body entries
- Focus on controlling your partner's arms to prevent lower body attacks
- Use underhooks to facilitate getting behind your partner
- Keep your posture strong to prevent your partner from getting lower

For the lower body controller:
- Look for opportunities to level change quickly to access the legs
- Time your attacks when your partner's weight is shifting
- Use hand fighting to create openings to penetrate to the legs
- Practice maintaining connection throughout your level change
- Be aware of your head position to avoid guillotines
