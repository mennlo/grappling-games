- Maintain distance to prevent being controlled
- Step to angles when establishing grips

For defenders:
- Use two hands to break one grip when possible
- Control distance to make gripping difficult
- Look for opportunities to establish your own grips while defending
- Keep your hands moving to avoid being gripped
