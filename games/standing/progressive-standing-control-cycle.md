# Progressive Standing Control Cycle

## Overview
A dynamic standing drill where the attacking player works to cycle through three control positions (front headlock, single leg, and bodylock) by first forcing their partner's hands to the mat before transitioning to the next position. The defending player works to escape to a neutral position at any point.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth  

### Attacking Player
**Position:** Starting with front headlock control, chest covering partner's head  
**Objective:** Force partner's hands to the mat, then transition to a new control position (cycling through front headlock, single leg, and bodylock)  
**Win:** Successfully complete a full cycle through all three positions (front headlock → single leg → bodylock → front headlock)  

### Defending Player
**Position:** Starting bent forward with head trapped in partner's front headlock control  
**Objective:** Disconnect from any control position and return to a neutral standing position  
**Win:** Successfully escape to a neutral position at any point  

## Instructions
1. Attacking player starts with front headlock control
2. Attacker works to force defender's hands to the mat
3. Once hands touch the mat, attacker transitions to either a single leg or bodylock
4. From the new position, attacker again works to force hands to the mat before transitioning to the next position
5. Positions should cycle in this order: front headlock → single leg → bodylock → front headlock
6. If defender escapes to neutral at any point, players switch roles
7. If attacker completes a full cycle, reset with the same roles
8. Switch roles after the predetermined time if no full cycle or escape occurs

## Coaching Points
For attacking players:
- Focus on downward pressure when trying to get your partner's hands to the mat
- Plan your transitions before forcing the hands down
- Maintain control during transitions - don't lose connection
- From front headlock, use pressure on the head and upper back
- For single leg, control the leg while maintaining upper body pressure
- With the bodylock, use chest pressure and off-balancing movements
- Be deliberate with each transition, don't rush between positions

For defending players:
- Maintain strong posture to avoid having your hands forced to the mat
- Look for opportunities to create space during transition moments
- Hand fight aggressively to prevent and break grips
- Use level changes and directional movement to create escape angles
- Focus on getting to a neutral position rather than just breaking the immediate grip
- Be aware of which position your partner is in and what the likely next transition will be
- Create frames with your arms to prevent your partner from establishing the next position
