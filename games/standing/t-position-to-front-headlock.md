For attacking players:
- Use your underhook to set up the head positioning for the front headlock
- Keep pressure forward and downward once you establish the front headlock
- Control your partner's arm positioning to limit their defensive options
- Focus on breaking your partner's posture to force their hands to the mat

For defending players:
- Maintain good posture to prevent your head from dropping
- Use hand fighting to prevent your partner from securing control of your head
- Work to re-establish inside position by framing and creating space
- If caught in the front headlock, focus on protecting your arms and creating an angle for escape
