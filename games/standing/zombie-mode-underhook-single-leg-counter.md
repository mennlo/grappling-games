# Zombie Mode 2: Underhook and Single Leg Counter

## Overview
An advanced variation of the Zombie Mode drill where the defending player not only denies contact but looks to establish underhooks or secure single leg takedowns when the "zombie" player's arms are extended.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacking Player ("Zombie")
**Position:** Standing, facing your partner with arms extended forward  
**Objective:** Move forward and try to place your hands anywhere on your partner's body  
**Win:** Successfully make contact with your hands on your partner  

### Defending Player
**Position:** Standing, facing your partner  
**Objective:** Deny your partner's hands from making contact and look for opportunities to wrap your arms around your partner (underhooks) or secure a single leg takedown  
**Win:** Successfully establish an underhook position or secure a single leg  

## Instructions
1. Partners start standing, facing each other at arm's length distance
2. Attacking player keeps arms extended forward like a "zombie"
3. Defending player works to deny contact and establish underhooks or secure single legs
4. After the defender successfully achieves two wins (underhooks or single legs), partners switch roles
5. Complete a 3-minute round for each partner (6 minutes total)

## Coaching Points
For the attacking player:
- Focus on changing levels and angles to find openings
- Be aware of your arm position to avoid easy underhooks
- Adjust your strategy when you notice the defender looking for underhooks
- Keep a strong posture to make it harder for the defender to control you

For the defending player:
- Look for opportunities to slip inside the extended arms
- Time your movements to coincide with the attacker's forward pressure
- Practice quickly transitioning from defense to offense
- Focus on achieving proper underhook position with chest-to-chest contact
- When going for single legs, use the zombie's extended arms as an opening to level change
- Practice securing the single leg with proper head position and leg control
- Use head position to help control the attacker when establishing underhooks or single legs
