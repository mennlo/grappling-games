# Foot Movement and Ankle Touch

## Overview
A symmetrical standing drill where both players simultaneously work to move their partner around and off-balance them using foot sweeps and touches, while focusing on touching their partner's feet and ankles with the bottom of their own feet without being swept themselves.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

**Position:** Standing facing your partner with collar and sleeve grips established
**Objective:** Move your partner around and touch their feet/ankles with the bottom of your feet while maintaining your own balance and avoiding being swept  
**Win:** Successfully sweep your partner (make them fall or go to their hands) while avoiding being swept yourself

## Instructions
1. Both players simultaneously work to move their partner around using push/pull movements
2. Focus on touching partner's feet/ankles with the bottom of your feet rather than heavy sweeps
3. Maintain your own balance and avoid being swept
4. Continue for the full time period, only resetting when someone gets swept
5. Switch gripping positions after 3 minutes if desired

## Coaching Points
For both players:
- Keep your partner moving constantly to create opportunities for foot touches
- Use light touches with the bottom of your feet rather than heavy kicks
- Coordinate your hand grips with foot movement to create off-balancing
- Stay mobile and keep your own feet moving to avoid being swept
- Focus on reaching out to touch when your partner steps or shifts weight
- Maintain balance while extending to touch - don't overcommit
- Use the movement patterns from the previous drill to set up foot touches
- Touching feet/ankles is practice for timing, but only sweeps count as wins
