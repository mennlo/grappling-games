# Progressive Touch to Bodylock

## Overview
A competitive standing drill where both partners start with no connections and race to achieve a bodylock by completing three progressive touches: underhook, hand behind the knee, or Russian tie control.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Player One
**Position:** Standing facing your partner with no initial connections  
**Objective:** Complete three touches (any combination of underhook, hand behind knee, or Russian tie) before establishing a bodylock, or bypass these requirements by shooting for a double leg takedown  
**Win:** Successfully complete three touches and establish a bodylock, or successfully execute a double leg takedown

### Player Two
**Position:** Standing facing your partner with no initial connections  
**Objective:** Complete three touches (any combination of underhook, hand behind knee, or Russian tie) before establishing a bodylock, or bypass these requirements by shooting for a double leg takedown  
**Win:** Successfully complete three touches and establish a bodylock, or successfully execute a double leg takedown

## Instructions
1. Both players start standing, facing each other with no connections
2. Both players simultaneously work to achieve any three touches from these options:
   - Establish an underhook
   - Get a hand behind partner's knee
   - Control partner's arm with both arms while outside (Russian tie)
3. Touches can be repeated (e.g., two underhooks and one hand behind knee)
4. After completing three touches, a player can establish a bodylock
5. Alternatively, either player can bypass the touch requirements by executing a double leg takedown
6. The first player to achieve their win condition ends the round

## Coaching Points
For both players:
- Use misdirection to set up your touches
- Chain your attempts together to create reactions
- Be deliberate with your setups rather than rushing
- Look for opportunities to shoot for the double leg when your partner is off-balance
- Balance between offensive actions and defensive reactions
- Maintain good defensive posture with hands ready to frame
- Stay balanced with a strong base
- Use head position to prevent your partner from getting too close
- Be ready to sprawl if your partner shoots for a double leg
