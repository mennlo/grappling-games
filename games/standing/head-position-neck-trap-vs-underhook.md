- Lower your level to get underneath their defenses
- Drive your head to the side of their neck with purpose
- Once connected, use your hands to trap and maintain the position
- Keep your head tight to their neck to prevent them from creating space
- Use your body position to block their underhook attempts

For underhook players:
- Keep your hands active to prevent head connection
- Frame with your hands to create distance when they attempt head position

- Time your underhook attempt when they commit to head position
- Use your head position to counter their head position attempts
- Stay mobile and change levels to create underhook opportunities
