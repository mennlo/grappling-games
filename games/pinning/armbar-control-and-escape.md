## Coaching Points
For top player:
- Focus on maintaining tight control of your partner's shoulders with your legs
- Use your legs to secure position before focusing on splitting the hands
- Work to isolate the arm by creating angles rather than just pulling
- Once hands are split, control the wrist and elbow to straighten the arm
- Apply breaking pressure slowly and with control after the 3-second period
- Adjust your hips to maximize leverage throughout the control sequence

For bottom player:
- Connect your hands in a strong defensive grip (palm-to-palm, figure-four, etc.)
- Use your legs to create movement and escape opportunities
- Look for opportunities to stack, roll, or turn into your partner
- If your hands get split, focus on bringing your elbow back to your body
