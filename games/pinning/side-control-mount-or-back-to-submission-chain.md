# Side Control to Mount/Back to Submission Chain

## Overview
A chained advancement game: the top player must flow from side control to either mount or chest-to-back and then secure a controlled submission catch-and-release. The bottom player works to interrupt links in the chain—preventing positional advancement or breaking submission attempts—using structured escapes, guard recovery, or reversal.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth  

### Top Player
**Position:** Any side control variation 
**Objective:** Advance to mount or chest-to-back and then obtain a clean submission catch (controlled, no crank)  
**Constraints:** Must achieve positional control stabilization (3-second mount OR seatbelt chest-to-back) before initiating submission attempt  
**Win:**  Stabilize mount or chest-to-back (seatbelt) AND obtain a clean controlled submission catch/finish (arm triangle, collar choke, armbar, back choke, etc.) before bottom player escapes

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Side control bottom with no frames
**Objective:** Disrupt chain at any link: deny positional advancement or defeat submission attempt via escape/recovery  
**Constraints:** 
**Win:** (a) Reguard (any guard position placing legs between), OR (b) reverse and come on top, OR (c) build to turtle with back uncovered

## Instructions
1. Set start: top in side control, bottom framing.
2. Top selects route based on bottom reaction; begin advancement (knee slide vs. head walk).
3. Upon achieving mount or back, hold stabilization count (3 seconds) before initiating submission.
4. Bottom continuously works frames, hip movement, guard recovery angles, turtle escapes.
5. If top secures a clean catch-and-release submission post stabilization—top win; reset.
6. If bottom wins by any escape/interrupt condition—reset.
7. Multiple reps inside round; switch roles after time.
