# Side Control to Mount Stabilization

## Overview
A positional advancement game focused on the top player flowing from side control to a stabilized mount position, while the bottom player aims to break the advancement early through guard recovery, reversal, or structured turtle. Emphasizes mount pathway recognition, knee slide mechanics, stabilization discipline, and early defensive disruption.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth  

### Top Player
**Position:** Any standard side control variation (may begin with crossface OR underhook—NOT both fully established)  
**Objective:** Advance to stabilized mount position  
**Constraints:** Must show incremental control (knee slide / hip walk); no diving leap to mount  
**Win:** Stabilize mount (both knees in, hips settled, chest connection) for a 3-second count  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Side control bottom (may begin flat or slight hip turn; at least one potential frame)  
**Objective:** Disrupt mount advancement at earliest link: maintain/rebuild frames, create hip escape angles, recover guard, reverse, or build structured turtle  
**Constraints:** Technical movement only—no explosive bench press shove; turtle must cover neck/hands  
**Win:** (a) Reguard (any guard placing legs between), OR (b) reverse and secure top position, OR (c) build to turtle with back uncovered

## Instructions
1. Set start: top has side control (one major control element: crossface OR underhook). Bottom presents at least one frame.
2. Top commits to mount pathway: knee slide and hip walk maintaining chest pressure.
3. Top advances via small wedges (knee slide, hip advancement) without spinning to back.
4. Bottom: frame → hip escape → angle (knee insertion or underhook rise) → guard / turtle / reversal decision.
5. On mount stabilization (3-count): top win → immediate reset.
6. On bottom reguard, reversal, or stable turtle: bottom win → reset.
7. Rapid reps within round; switch roles after time.
