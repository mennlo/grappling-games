- Focus on one hand at a time if both are difficult to control
- Use your legs to help control your partner's body position
- Look for opportunities when hands become exposed during movement
- Maintain chest-to-back connection throughout the drill

For defending players:
- Keep your hands close to your body and protected
- Use small movements to constantly adjust hand positioning
- Don't sacrifice your defensive structure just to protect hands
- Be aware of pressure changes that might create opportunities to hide hands
- Remember that in this drill you're not trying to escape, just protect hands
