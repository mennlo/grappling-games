## Overview
A drill focusing on progressing from any variation of side control to either s-mount position or arm triangle position. The top player works to advance their position while the bottom player defends and attempts to recover guard.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

| | Top Player | Bottom Player |
|---|---|---|
| **Position** | In any variation of side control on your partner | On back with partner in any variation of side control |
| **Objective** | Advance to s-mount position or arm triangle position | Recover guard by getting both knees between you and your partner or establishing closed guard |
| **Constraints** | Must stay out of guard | None |
| **Win** | Successfully achieve s-mount position or arm triangle position and hold for 3 seconds (can finish submission if agreed with partner) | Successfully get both knees in between you and your partner or establish closed guard |

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in any variation of side control
2. Top player works to advance to s-mount or arm triangle position
3. Bottom player works to recover guard by getting knees in or closing guard
4. If the bottom player gets both knees between them and partner or establishes closed guard, reset to starting position
5. If the top player achieves s-mount or arm triangle position and holds for 3 seconds (or finishes submission if agreed), reset to starting position
6. After time expires, switch roles

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Control the near arm to set up arm triangle opportunities
- Use knee on belly as a transitional position toward s-mount
- Maintain heavy pressure to prevent guard recovery
- Look for opportunities when bottom player makes space to insert your knee
- Chain transitions between mount, s-mount, and arm triangle setups
- Keep your weight distributed and base strong

For the bottom player:
- Create frames early to prevent them from isolating your arms
- Use hip escapes to create space for knee insertion
- Focus on getting one knee in first, then the second
- Don't give up the underhook or allow arm isolation
- Bridge and shrimp in combination to create movement opportunities
- Be aware of arm triangle setups when they control your near arm
