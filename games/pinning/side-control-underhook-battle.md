# Side Control Underhook Battle

## Overview
A pinning game focused on the critical battle when the bottom player has earned an underhook and a hip frame but is still flat. The top player must neutralize the underhook threat before the bottom player can create an escape pathway. This isolates timing, pressure, and decision-making around transitioning between escape chains and consolidation of top control or back exposure.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** Flat on back with far-side underhook and near-side frame at top player's hip
**Objective:** Convert the underhook + frame combination into an escape: reguard, reversal, or build to knees/feet  
**Constraints:** Must start flat
**Win:** (a) Get your legs back in between you and the top player (any guard besides quarter guard), OR (b) reverse and come on top, OR (c) successfully get up to your knees or feet  

### Top Player
**Position:** Chest-to-chest side control, arms any configuration (no initial locked crossface/underhook)  
**Objective:** Shut down the underhook threat, flatten and consolidate dominant control pathways  
**Constraints:** No immediate jump to knee-on-belly or mount until control condition achieved  
**Win:** (a) Establish solid crossface + underhook control, OR (b) transition to chest-to-back with seatbelt grip

## Instructions
1. Set start: Bottom has underhook (elbow tight) and hip frame; top is chest-to-chest without secured crossface/underhook.
2. On go, bottom initiates structured escape chain: frame → hip escape/shoulder walk → angle or knee insertion OR underhook bump to come up.
3. Top immediately addresses underhook: sprawl hip, crossface fight, shoulder pressure, pummel for far underhook, or turn corner to expose back.
4. If bottom reguards, reverses, or builds to knees/feet—bottom win; quick reset.
5. If top consolidates crossface + underhook or secures chest-to-back seatbelt—top win; reset.
6. Repeat rapid reps inside round; switch roles after time.
