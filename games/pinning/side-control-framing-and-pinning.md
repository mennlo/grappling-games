2. Top player starts on top, in front of the bottom player's legs

6. Switch roles after the time period

## Coaching Points
For bottom players:
- Keep your frames active and connected to key control points (hip and neck)
- Use bridge and hip escape movements in combination to create space
- Look for opportunities to bring your knees back into the position
- Anticipate and counter the top player's attempts to establish the crossface

For top players:
- Apply pressure strategically rather than just pushing forward
- Work to isolate and remove one frame at a time
- Use level changes and weight shifts to break the bottom player's structure
- Once you establish the crossface, focus on securing the underhook to complete control
