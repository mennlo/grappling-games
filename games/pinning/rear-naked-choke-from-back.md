# Rear Naked Choke from Back

## Overview
A rear naked choke drill where the attacking partner works to close a loop around the defender's head while maintaining back control. The focus is on proper choke mechanics and timing from the back position.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Attacking Player
**Position:** Back control with both hooks in and figure four grip on the defending player's arm  
**Objective:** Close a loop around your partner's head with your arms for rear naked choke setup  
**Win:** Successfully close the loop around the head or finish the choke (with partner's agreement)  

### Defending Player
**Position:** Being controlled from the back, rolled towards attacker's underhook side  
**Objective:** Prevent the choke setup and escape back control  
**Win:** Successfully escape back control before the loop is closed  

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the attacking player in back control, rolled towards their underhook side
2. Attacking player has underhook arm controlling the defender's opposite side wrist
3. Attacking player works to establish the rear naked choke by closing a loop around the head
4. Once the loop is closed, partners can agree to continue until the choke is finished
5. Defending player works to prevent the choke setup and escape back control
6. On successful choke setup/finish or escape, switch roles and reset
7. Continue for the full time period
8. After time expires, switch roles completely

## Coaching Points
For the attacking player:
- Maintain back control while working for the choke
- Use your underhook to control the defender's posture
- Work to get your choking arm under the defender's chin
- Create the "loop" by connecting your hands behind the defender's head
- Apply pressure gradually and communicate with your partner
- Don't rush the setup - establish position first
- Use your legs to control the defender's hips and prevent escapes

For the defending player:
- Protect your neck by keeping your chin down
- Use your hands to prevent the choking arm from getting under your chin
- Work to turn towards the attacking player to escape
- Create frames to prevent the choke setup
- Focus on escaping back control rather than just defending the choke
- Use hip movement and bridges to create escape opportunities
- Communicate clearly if you need to tap during choke attempts
