## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Focus on deep grip placement with the first hand (thumb inside collar, fingers outside)
- Ensure the second grip complements the first for maximum pressure
- Maintain proper posture throughout the choke application
- Use your body weight rather than arm strength to apply pressure
- Practice proper timing and weight distribution to prevent the bottom player from escaping

For the bottom player:
- Provide clear feedback on grip placement and pressure
- Help identify when posture or weight distribution issues are preventing effective technique
- Note when defensive opportunities arise that the top player should be aware of
- Practice being a good training partner by allowing appropriate technique development
