**Win:** Successfully secure a submission from mount or take your partner's back with at least one hook in

### Bottom Player

3. Top player can pursue collar chokes, armbars, americanas, or any other mount submissions
4. Top player can also look for opportunities to take the back as an alternative win condition
5. Bottom player works to escape mount by either returning to guard or reversing the position

7. Switch roles after the predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For top player:
- Keep your weight low and distributed to maintain the mount
- Chain your attacks together - use one submission attempt to set up another
- If pursuing armbars, keep your weight on your partner and don't let them roll
- For americanas, secure the arm and maintain control before attempting the finish
- If your partner turns to their side, be ready to transition to back control
- Keep your hips heavy and base wide to prevent being rolled over
- Don't overcommit to one submission - be ready to flow to the next opportunity

For bottom player:
- Use your arms to frame and create space before attempting escapes
- Focus on controlling at least one leg when working back to guard
- Bridge and roll towards the side where the top player is less posted
- Protect your arms by keeping your elbows tight and hands near your chest
- Don't give up your back when turning to your side
- Be explosive with your escape attempts when you create space
- Keep your neck protected when defending collar chokes
