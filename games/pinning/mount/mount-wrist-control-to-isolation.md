# Mount Wrist Control to Isolation

## Overview
A drill focusing on establishing wrist control from the mount position and using it to isolate both of the bottom player's arms in preparation for submissions. The top player works to get under both arms and pin them bicep to ear, while the bottom player tries to free their wrists and establish defensive frames.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Mounted on top with wrist control on one of the bottom player's arms  
**Objective:** Use wrist control to get under both of the bottom player's arms and isolate them bicep to ear  
**Win:** Successfully isolate both arms bicep to ear for 3 seconds  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back with partner mounted on top, one wrist controlled  
**Objective:** Free your wrists and get your hands on the top player's hips for defensive frames  
**Win:** Successfully free both wrists and get both hands on the top player's hips  

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in mount position with wrist control on one arm
2. Top player works to establish control of both wrists and use this control to isolate the arms
3. Top player's goal is to get under both arms and pin them bicep to ear position
4. Bottom player works to free their wrists and establish defensive frames on the hips
5. Top player must maintain mount position throughout the drill
6. If the bottom player successfully gets both hands on hips, reset to starting position
7. If the top player achieves bicep to ear isolation for 3 seconds, reset to starting position
8. After time expires, switch roles

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Maintain mount position with good base and weight distribution
- Use wrist control to prevent defensive frames
- Work one arm at a time to establish isolation
- Keep your weight forward to prevent bridges and escapes
- Use your chest and shoulder pressure to pin the arms once isolated
- Transition smoothly from wrist control to arm isolation
- Look for opportunities to set up submissions once isolation is achieved

For the bottom player:
- Work to free your wrists using circular motions and timing
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create momentary space
- Focus on getting hands to the hips for defensive frames
- Keep your elbows tight to your body when possible
- Don't allow both wrists to be controlled simultaneously
- Use head movement and shoulder mobility to prevent full isolation
- Be patient and look for moments when the top player's base is compromised
