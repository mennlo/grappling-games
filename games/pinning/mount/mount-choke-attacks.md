# Mount Choke Attacks

## Overview
A positional drill where the top player starts with mount and either the bottom player's wrist pinned to the mat or a hand in the collar, working to transition into various choke attacks (arm triangle, guillotine, or collar chokes), while the bottom player works to recover guard or reverse the position.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Mounted on top with either the bottom player's wrist pinned to the mat or a hand in the collar  
**Objective:** Maintain mount position while transitioning into any choke attack - arm triangle, guillotine, or collar chokes  
**Win:** Successfully establish any choke position while maintaining mount (don't need to finish the submission)  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back in mount position with either one wrist pinned to the mat or your partner's hand in your collar  
**Objective:** Defend against the choke setups and work to recover guard or reverse position  
**Win:** Successfully return to guard with control of at least one leg above the knee, or successfully reverse the position to become the top player 

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in mount position
2. Top player begins with either the bottom player's wrist pinned to the mat or a hand in the collar
3. Top player works to set up any of the three choke options:
   - Arm triangle by isolating the trapped arm across the neck
   - Guillotine by threading under the chin as bottom player turns
   - Collar chokes using the gi lapels (if training in gi)
4. Bottom player defends and looks for opportunities to recover guard or reverse the position
5. If top player establishes a choke position or if bottom player successfully escapes, reset to starting position
6. Complete a 3-minute round for each partner (6 minutes total)

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Use your weight to maintain pressure on the pinned wrist
- For arm triangle: work to isolate the trapped arm across the face, bring your shoulder down, and establish head and arm control
- For guillotine: watch for when bottom player turns to their side, thread your arm under the chin, and connect your hands
- For collar chokes: establish grips on the lapels and apply appropriate mechanics for cross collar or loop chokes
- Keep your center of gravity low to prevent being reversed
- Be prepared to follow the bottom player's movements to maintain mount
- Transition smoothly between different choke options based on bottom player's reactions

For the bottom player:
- Use bridges and hip movement to create space
- Work to free your trapped wrist before chokes are fully established
- Keep your elbows tight to prevent arm triangle setups
- Tuck your chin to defend against guillotine attempts when turning
- If training in gi, control the lapels to prevent collar choke grips
- Look for opportunities to trap the top player's leg for half guard recovery
- Time your escape attempts with the top player's transitions
- Create frames when possible to generate space for guard recovery
