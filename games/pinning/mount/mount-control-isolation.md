# Mount Control and Isolation

## Overview
A drill focusing on maintaining top control while keeping the bottom player's arms isolated away from their body, which sets up various attacks including the arm triangle. The top player can transition between dominant positions as long as they stay out of guard.

## Details
**Time:** 2 minutes, 2 partners or 4 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Mounted on top with arms under both of the bottom player's elbows and bottom player's arms up around their head  
**Objective:** Maintain a dominant position while keeping at least one of the bottom player's elbows isolated away from their body  
**Win:** Successfully keep at least one elbow isolated for the duration of the round while staying out of guard  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back with partner mounted on top, arms isolated with elbows away from ribs  
**Objective:** Get both elbows back to ribs while working to improve position  
**Win:** Successfully return both elbows to the ribs or establish guard  

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in mount position with arms under both of the bottom player's elbows
2. Bottom player's arms are initially isolated with elbows away from the ribs (up around their head)
3. Top player focuses on maintaining a dominant position (doesn't have to stay in mount) while keeping at least one elbow isolated
4. Bottom player works to bring both elbows back to their ribs while working to establish guard
5. If the bottom player establishes guard or gets both elbows back to their ribs, reset to starting position
6. After time expires, switch roles
7. Complete a 2-minute round for each partner (4 minutes total)

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Keep your base wide and weight low to maintain stability
- Use your knees to pin your partner's shoulders or upper arms
- Distribute your weight to keep pressure on the isolated arm
- If one elbow escapes, focus on maintaining control of the other elbow
- Use hip movements to follow your partner's movements while maintaining the isolation
- Be willing to transition between positions (mount, side control, north-south, knee on belly) as needed
- Look for opportunities to use the isolation for submission attacks

For the bottom player:
- Work on bringing one elbow back to your ribs at a time
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create momentary space for elbow recovery
- Combine elbow recovery attempts with guard recovery techniques
- Frame against the hips to create space
- Focus on establishing guard rather than just escaping mount
- Be aware that getting elbows back is the first step in defending many upper body submissions
