## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Start by isolating the arms before attempting submissions
- Maintain good base and weight distribution throughout
- Look for arm triangle, armbar, ezekiel, and cross collar choke opportunities
- Use your weight to prevent bridges and hip escapes
- Transition between submission attempts while maintaining control
- Don't rush submissions - establish control first
- Be aware of the bottom player's escape attempts and counter them
- Use your knees to control the bottom player's shoulders and arms

For the bottom player:
- Focus on preventing arm isolation as your first priority
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create space for guard recovery
- Work to get your knees between you and your partner
- Control the legs above the knee for effective guard establishment
- Look for opportunities to trap an arm and roll your partner over
- Don't give up your neck or allow arm isolation
- Use head movement and shoulder mobility to prevent submissions
- Time your escape attempts when the top player is transitioning between attacks
- Consider going to your side to prevent some submission setups
