## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Maintain pressure on your partner's neck and isolated arm throughout the transition
- Slide your knee across their body as you transition
- Keep your weight on their upper body to prevent them from following your movement
- Ensure you maintain the arm triangle grip during the entire transition
- Land in the proper side control position with your chest tight against their shoulder

For the bottom player:
- Look for the moment of transition to create space and escape
- Bridge into the top player as they move to disrupt their balance
- Try to free your trapped arm during the transition
- Work to recompose your guard if possible
- Understand that defending this transition helps you learn how to properly execute it
