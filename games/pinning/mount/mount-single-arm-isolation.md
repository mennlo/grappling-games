# Mount Control Single Arm Isolation

## Overview
A drill focusing on maintaining top control while keeping one of the bottom player's arms isolated away from their body, which sets up various attacks including the arm triangle. The top player can transition between dominant positions as long as they stay out of guard.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

| | Top Player | Bottom Player |
|---|---|---|
| **Position** | Mounted on top with arm under one of the bottom player's elbows and bottom player's arm up around their head | On back with partner mounted on top, one arm isolated with elbow away from ribs |
| **Objective** | Get both of the bottom player's arms up by their ears | Recover defensive position by bringing elbow back to ribs or establishing guard |
| **Constraints** | Must stay out of guard | None |
| **Win** | Successfully get both arms up by the bottom player's ears and hold for 3 seconds | Successfully get both hands on the hips with no arms under the elbows or get to guard |

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in mount position with arm under one of the bottom player's elbows
2. Bottom player's arm is initially isolated with elbow away from the ribs (up around their head)
3. Top player focuses on maintaining a dominant position (doesn't have to stay in mount) while keeping the elbow isolated
4. Bottom player works to bring the elbow back to their ribs while working to establish guard
5. If the bottom player establishes guard or gets the elbow back to their ribs, reset to starting position
6. After time expires, switch roles
7. Complete a 3-minute round for each partner (6 minutes total)

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Keep your base wide and weight low to maintain stability
- Use your knees to pin your partner's shoulders or upper arms
- Distribute your weight to keep pressure on the isolated arm
- Use hip movements to follow your partner's movements while maintaining the isolation
- Be willing to transition between positions (mount, side control, north-south, knee on belly) as needed
- Look for opportunities to use the isolation for submission attacks

For the bottom player:
- Work on bringing the elbow back to your ribs
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create momentary space for elbow recovery
- Combine elbow recovery attempts with guard recovery techniques
- Frame against the hips to create space
- Focus on establishing guard rather than just escaping mount
- Be aware that getting elbows back is the first step in defending many upper body submissions
