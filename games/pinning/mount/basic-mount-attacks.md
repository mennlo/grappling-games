## Instructions
1. Top player establishes basic mount position (no collar grip, legs not behind elbows)
2. Top player works to improve position by getting collar grips or legs behind elbows
3. Top player can attempt submissions or transitions once control is established
4. Bottom player works to defend and escape through various methods

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Focus first on establishing a stable mount position before attacking
- Work on progressing to more dominant control positions (collar grip, legs behind elbows)
- Practice weight distribution to counter escape attempts
- Recognize and capitalize on opportunities that arise during partner's escape attempts
- Develop sensitivity to weight shifts that signal escape attempts

For the bottom player:
- Take advantage of the neutral starting position to initiate escapes early
- Work on elbow-knee connections to protect your space
- Practice creating frames to prevent the top player from establishing dominant grips
- Use bridges and hip movements to disrupt the top player's balance
- Focus on protecting your neck and arms while working escapes
