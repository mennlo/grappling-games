# Mount S-Mount and Arm Triangle Progression

## Overview
A drill focusing on progressing from arm isolation in mount to either s-mount position or arm triangle position. The top player works to advance their position while the bottom player defends and attempts to recover.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

| | Top Player | Bottom Player |
|---|---|---|
| **Position** | Mounted on top with arm under one of the bottom player's elbows and bottom player's arm up around their head | On back with partner mounted on top, one arm isolated with elbow away from ribs |
| **Objective** | Advance to s-mount position or arm triangle position | Recover defensive position by bringing elbow back to ribs or establishing guard |
| **Constraints** | Must stay out of guard | None |
| **Win** | Successfully achieve s-mount position or arm triangle position and hold for 3 seconds (can finish submission if agreed with partner) | Successfully get both hands on the hips with no arms under the elbows or get to guard |

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in mount position with arm under one of the bottom player's elbows
2. Bottom player's arm is initially isolated with elbow away from the ribs (up around their head)
3. Top player works to advance to s-mount or arm triangle position
4. Bottom player works to bring the elbow back to their ribs while working to establish guard
5. If the bottom player establishes guard or gets the elbow back to their ribs, reset to starting position
6. If the top player achieves s-mount or arm triangle position and holds for 3 seconds (or finishes submission if agreed), reset to starting position
7. After time expires, switch roles

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Maintain the arm isolation as you transition to s-mount or arm triangle
- For s-mount: walk one leg high up near the head while keeping the other leg base
- For arm triangle: secure the trapped arm position, lock your hands, and drive your shoulder into their neck
- Keep your weight distributed to maintain control throughout the transition
- Be patient and methodical with your progression
- If partner defends one option, switch to the other

For the bottom player:
- Recognize s-mount and arm triangle setups early
- Create frames and space before they can lock in positions
- Use bridges and hip escapes to disrupt their base during transitions
- Focus on recovering the isolated elbow as quickly as possible
- If they commit to s-mount, focus on tucking your chin and framing
- If they commit to arm triangle, work to free your trapped arm immediately
