# Mount Collar Choke or Back Take

## Overview
A mount control drill where the top player works to secure a collar choke by covering both sides of the bottom player's neck with their wrists/forearms, or takes their partner's back. The bottom player works to escape back to guard or reverse the position.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Mounted on your partner with a hand in the collar  
**Objective:** Stay mounted and cover both sides of your partner's neck with your wrists/forearms to set up a collar choke, or take your partner's back  
**Win:** Successfully cover both sides of your partner's neck with your wrists/forearms in preparation for a collar choke, or take your partner's back with at least one hook in

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On your back with your partner mounted and a hand in your collar  
**Objective:** Get back to guard with at least one of the top player's legs controlled above the knee, or roll them over and become the top player  
**Win:** Successfully return to guard with control of at least one leg above the knee, or successfully reverse the position to become the top player

## Instructions
1. Top player starts mounted on bottom player with one hand already in the collar
2. Top player works to maintain mount while working to cover both sides of the neck with wrists/forearms
3. Top player can also look for opportunities to take the back as an alternative win condition
4. Bottom player works to escape mount by either returning to guard or reversing the position
5. If the top player is having success covering both sides of the neck, they should progress to attempting to finish the choke
6. Reset when either player achieves their win condition
7. Switch roles after the predetermined time

## Coaching Points
For top player:
- Keep your weight low and distributed to maintain the mount
- Use your free hand to control your partner's defending arms
- Work methodically to get your second hand to the collar or position your wrists/forearms on both sides of the neck
- If your partner turns to their side, be ready to transition to back control
- Keep your hips heavy and base wide to prevent being rolled over
- Once both sides of the neck are covered, work to finish the choke by pulling and tightening

For bottom player:
- Use your arms to frame and create space before attempting escapes
- Focus on controlling at least one leg when working back to guard
- Bridge and roll towards the side where the top player is less posted
- Protect your neck by keeping your chin tucked and hands up
- Don't give up your back when turning to your side
- Be explosive with your escape attempts when you create space
