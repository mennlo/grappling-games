# Mount Wrist Control to Submission

## Overview
A drill starting from mount with wrist control where the top player works to maintain control and secure submissions from any top position (mount, side control, knee on belly, back control, etc.) while staying out of guard. The bottom player works to free their wrists, establish defensive frames, and escape to guard or reverse position.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** Mounted on top with wrist control on one of the bottom player's arms  
**Objective:** Maintain wrist control and work to submit the bottom player from any dominant position (including back control) while staying out of their guard  
**Win:** Successfully submit the bottom player with any submission while maintaining a dominant position (mount, side control, knee on belly, back control, etc.)

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back with partner mounted on top, one wrist controlled  
**Objective:** Free your wrists, establish defensive frames, and escape to guard or reverse position  
**Win:** Get back to guard with at least one of the top player's legs controlled above the knee, or roll them over and become the top player

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in mount position with wrist control on one arm
2. Top player works to maintain control and hunt for submissions from any top position
3. Top player can transition to side control, knee on belly, back control, or other top positions but must stay out of guard
4. Bottom player works to free their wrists, establish defensive frames, and escape
5. Bottom player must control at least one leg above the knee (ankle traps don't count) to win via guard recovery
6. If bottom player achieves guard with leg control or becomes top player, they win the round
7. If top player submits bottom player from any top position, they win the round
8. Reset and continue for the full time period
9. After time expires, switch roles

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Start by using wrist control to prevent defensive frames
- Maintain control while transitioning between top positions
- Look for arm isolation opportunities for arm triangles, armbars, and kimuras
- Use your base and weight distribution to prevent guard recovery
- Don't rush into submissions - establish control first
- Be aware of the bottom player's escape attempts and counter them
- Stay mobile and transition positions to create submission opportunities
- Consider transitioning to back control when the bottom player turns to their side
- If moving to side control or back, maintain wrist control throughout the transition
- From back control, look for rear naked chokes, arm traps, and bow and arrow setups

For the bottom player:
- Work to free your wrists using circular motions and timing
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create space for guard recovery
- Focus on getting your knees between you and your partner
- Control the legs above the knee for effective guard establishment
- Look for opportunities to trap an arm and roll your partner over
- Don't give up your neck or allow full arm isolation
- Use head movement and shoulder mobility to prevent submissions
- Time your escape attempts when the top player is transitioning between positions
- Be persistent in working to establish defensive frames on the hips
