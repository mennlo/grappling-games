## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Use your weight to maintain pressure on the pinned wrist
- Work to isolate the trapped arm by bringing your knee up on that side
- Keep your center of gravity low to prevent being reversed
- Use your free hand to establish head and shoulder control
- Be prepared to follow the bottom player if they turn to maintain control

For the bottom player:
- Use bridges and hip movement to create space
- Work to free your trapped wrist before the arm triangle is fully established
- Look for opportunities to trap the top player's leg for half guard recovery
- Try to keep your elbow tight to your body on the trapped side
- Time your escape attempts with the top player's transitions
