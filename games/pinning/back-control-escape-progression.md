# Back Control Escape Progression

## Overview
A progressive drill with three increasing levels of back control difficulty that the defender must escape from, building defensive skills systematically from basic to advanced positions.

## Details
**Time:** 2 minutes each level, 6 minutes total

### Level 1: No Hooks
**Attacking Player Position:** Sitting up chest to back with seatbelt grip, no hooks  
**Defending Player Win:** Escape chest to back connection

### Level 2: Both Hooks  
**Attacking Player Position:** Sitting up chest to back with seatbelt grip and both hooks in  
**Defending Player Win:** Escape chest to back connection

### Level 3: Both Hooks with Chokes
**Attacking Player Position:** Sitting up chest to back with seatbelt grip, both hooks in, and can attempt chokes  
**Defending Player Win:** Escape chest to back connection while defending choke attempts  

## Instructions
1. Complete each level for 2 minutes before progressing to the next
2. Attacking player maintains the specified level of control starting from sitting up chest to back position
3. All levels start with attacker having seatbelt grip established
4. Defending player works to achieve the win condition for that level
5. Reset to starting position after each successful escape
6. If defending player cannot escape within 30 seconds, reset anyway
7. After completing all 3 levels, switch roles
8. Complete the full progression twice (once for each partner as defender)

## Coaching Points
### Level 1 - No Hooks:
**For defenders:**
- Focus on turning towards the attacking player
- Use shoulder rolls and hip movement to create space
- Work to break the seatbelt grip systematically

**For attackers:**
- Maintain chest-to-back pressure and seatbelt grip
- Work to control without using hooks

### Level 2 - Both Hooks:
**For defenders:**
- Address one hook at a time while maintaining seatbelt defense
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create space
- Focus on removing hooks before attempting to turn

**For attackers:**
- Maintain both hooks and seatbelt grip throughout
- Use hooks to control defender's hip movement

### Level 3 - Both Hooks with Chokes:
**For defenders:**
- Prioritize choke defense while working escape techniques
- Keep chin down and hands fighting choke attempts
- Stay calm and work systematically despite submission pressure

**For attackers:**
- Attempt realistic choke setups while maintaining control
- Focus on proper choke mechanics rather than forcing submissions
- Allow escapes when properly executed by defender
