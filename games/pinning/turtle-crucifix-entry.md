## Coaching Points
For attacking players:
- Use hip pressure to flatten the defender and prevent mobility
- Approach from the near arm side, trapping it with your torso
- Keep your weight centered over the trapped arm
- Secure the far arm by controlling the wrist or tricep
- Thread your legs under their hips for solid control
- Maintain pressure throughout the position to prevent escapes
- Stay aware of the defender's turning attempts
- Use head and chest position to block their rotation
