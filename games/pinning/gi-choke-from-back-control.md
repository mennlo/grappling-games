For the attacking player:
- Prioritize establishing both collar grips before attempting submissions
- Use your underhook to control the defender while working for grips
- Look for cross collar choke, bow and arrow, and collar choke opportunities
- Maintain back control while establishing grips
- Work one grip at a time, securing each before moving to the next
- Use your body weight to help maintain grips once established
- Be patient with grip fighting - don't rush the setup

For the defending player:
- Fight the grips aggressively by controlling the attacking player's wrists
- Use collar ties and grip breaks to prevent collar control
- Work to escape back control while defending grips
- Keep your posture tight to make grip establishment difficult
- Use your own gi grips to control the attacking player's movement
- Focus on turning towards the attacking player to escape
- Don't allow both collars to be controlled simultaneously
