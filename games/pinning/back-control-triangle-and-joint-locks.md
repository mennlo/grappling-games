## Coaching Points
For attacking players:
- Maintain back control while transitioning to submission setups
- Use the figure four grip to control the defender's arm for joint lock entries
- For triangles: work to get your leg over the defender's shoulder while controlling their arm
- For shoulder locks: use your legs and figure four grip to isolate the arm and attack the shoulder
- For elbow locks: extend the figure four grip into full armbar position
- Keep your chest tight to their back to prevent early escapes
- Be willing to transition between different submission types as opportunities arise
- Maintain control even if you lose hooks during submission attempts

For defending players:
- Work to separate the attacker's hands to break figure four grip early
- Protect your arms by keeping elbows tight and defending grips
- If triangle is being set up, fight to keep your posture and prevent leg from getting over your shoulder
- For shoulder locks, keep your elbow tight to your body and work to turn into the pressure
- For elbow locks, hide your arm by keeping it close to your body and work to escape before full extension
- Focus on removing hooks to create escape opportunities
- Use bridges and hip escapes to create space for position changes
- If caught in an active submission, prioritize defending the submission before attempting full escape
- Be aware of multiple attack threats and defend accordingly
