# Side Control Head and Arm Attacks

## Overview
A transitional drill focusing on advancing from side control to various head and arm attacks (arm triangle, darce, anaconda, or guillotine), with the bottom player having only limited frames to defend.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** On top in side control with an underhook on the far arm and crossface control  
**Objective:** Work the underhook up toward the shoulder line and set up any head and arm attack (arm triangle, darce, anaconda, or guillotine)  
**Win:** Successfully establish head and arm connection or finish any head and arm submission  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back in bottom side control with only a frame at the hip  
**Objective:** Use limited defensive resources to recover guard or reverse the position  
**Win:** Successfully return to guard with control of at least one leg above the knee, or successfully reverse the position to become the top player 

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in side control with established underhook and crossface
2. Bottom player begins with only a single frame at the hip (no neck frame)
3. Top player works to advance the underhook toward the shoulder line
4. Top player works to establish any head and arm control (arm triangle, darce, anaconda, or guillotine)
5. Bottom player defends with the limited frames and looks to recover guard or reverse
6. If bottom player successfully escapes or reverses, reset to starting position
7. Complete a 3-minute round for each partner (6 minutes total)

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Use your weight distribution to neutralize the bottom player's single hip frame
- Work the underhook progressively deeper toward the shoulder to isolate the arm
- Apply crossface pressure to limit the bottom player's mobility and head movement
- Maintain tight upper body control throughout transitions
- For arm triangle, keep your chest tight against their shoulder
- For darce/anaconda, look for threading opportunities when their arm is exposed
- For guillotine setups, focus on chin strap control before connecting your hands
- Be prepared to follow the bottom player's defensive movements

For the bottom player:
- Maximize the effectiveness of your single hip frame
- Work to reestablish frames at the earliest opportunity
- Time your escape attempts when the top player transitions from side control to mount
- Protect your trapped arm from being further isolated across your face
- Look to create space with bridges and hip movements
- Recognize when to switch from defensive to offensive escapes
- Try to reclaim half guard as a transitional position to full guard recovery
