# Side Control to Mounted Arm Triangle

## Overview
A transitional drill focusing on advancing from side control to mount while setting up an arm triangle or arm-in ezekiel choke, with the bottom player having only limited frames to defend.

## Details
**Time:** 3 minutes, 2 partners or 6 minutes total - switching back and forth

### Top Player
**Position:** On top in side control with an underhook on the far arm and crossface control  
**Objective:** Work the underhook up toward the shoulder line, transition to mount, and set up an arm triangle or arm-in ezekiel  
**Win:** Successfully finish the arm triangle/ezekiel or establish the final position (as agreed with partner)  

### Bottom Player
**Position:** On back in bottom side control with only a frame at the hip  
**Objective:** Use limited defensive resources to recover guard or reverse the position  
**Win:** Successfully recover any form of guard or reverse the position  

## Instructions
1. Partners start with the top player in side control with established underhook and crossface
2. Bottom player begins with only a single frame at the hip (no neck frame)
3. Top player works to advance the underhook toward the shoulder line and transition to mount
4. From mount, top player works to establish the arm triangle or arm-in ezekiel
5. Bottom player defends with the limited frames and looks to recover guard or reverse
6. If bottom player successfully escapes or reverses, reset to starting position
7. Complete a 3-minute round for each partner (6 minutes total)

## Coaching Points
For the top player:
- Use your weight distribution to neutralize the bottom player's single hip frame
- Work the underhook progressively deeper toward the shoulder to isolate the arm
- Apply crossface pressure to limit the bottom player's mobility and head movement
- During the transition to mount, maintain tight upper body control
- Keep your chest tight against their shoulder when setting up the arm triangle
- For the arm-in ezekiel option, control the head while threading your hand through
- Be prepared to follow the bottom player's defensive movements

For the bottom player:
- Maximize the effectiveness of your single hip frame
- Work to reestablish frames at the earliest opportunity
- Time your escape attempts when the top player transitions from side control to mount
- Protect your trapped arm from being further isolated across your face
- Look to create space with bridges and hip movements
- Recognize when to switch from defensive to offensive escapes
- Try to reclaim half guard as a transitional position to full guard recovery
